    "## Overview\n",
    "\n",
    "This lesson will cover three sections:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Prepping the data\n",
    "- Running NER\n",
    "- Visualizing the data\n",
    "\n",

    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson we will learn how to extract place names from text. We will do so in two ways:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Using known place names\n",
    "- Natural Language Processing\n",
    "\n",
    "Natural Language Processing (NLP) teaches computers how to \"read\" and understand text like humans do. When we want to find place names in text, this becomes tricky because the same word can mean different things depending on how it's used.\n",
    "\n",
    "For example: \n",
    "\n",
    "- I visited **Washington** last summer and saw the Capitol building.\n",
    "- **Washington** led the Continental Army during the Revolutionary War.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the first sentence, \"Washington\" refers to Washington D.C. (a place). In the second sentence, \"Washington\" refers to George Washington (a person, not a place). Humans can easily tell the difference, but computers need help figuring this out.\n",
    "\n",
    "If we had a system where we simply gave computers a list of place names, we would get a lot of false positives. Therefore linguists started teaching computers the rules of grammar so they could understand **parts of speech**. By knowing *how* a word is being used, computers get more accurate in predicting what the word means in that context. \n",
    "\n",
    "By having a basic grammar it is easier to figure out what a word means:\n",
    "\n",
    "- The weather in London was cold and foggy.\n",
    "- Jack London wrote *Call of the Wild*.\n",
    "\n",
    "Here, a computer can figure out that the first \"London\" is a place (because we say \"in London\"), while \"Jack London\" is a person's name because it is performing the verb \"write\", something cities generally don't do.\n",
    "\n",
    "Over time, more sophisticated models have developed to help computers understand how language is being used. This process of finding locations, people, organizations, and other important information in text is called Named Entity Recognition (NER). It's very useful because it helps us understand what a text is really about, beyond just counting words."

         "Holy shit dude I thought I was the only one! My freshman year, my suite mates and I though it would be funny to climb the DHub sign one night and take a picture. We started trying to climb up when we heard someone shout at us. We immediately thought it was the cops, but dear god it was so much worse. Standing between us and the exit was President Alger. He just stared at us in the darkness for a good 30 seconds, and none of us knew what the fuck to do. Then all of a sudden, the man spreads his arms out in a T-pose, and sprints straight towards us. This had to have been the fastest sprint I’ve ever seen in my life. He ran straight into our group, and with his outstretched arms, clotheslined every single one of us. We all fell to the ground, out cold. We woke up in the morning, barely able to remember what happened. I never knew if I dreamed it or not. Thank god you posted this, now I don’t feel quite so alone.",

    "Doing one extraction on one sentence in `spacy` is pretty straight forward. We simply run the function `nlp()` on whatever sentence we want to analyze and save the result to a new variable, usually called `doc`. When we run this on a column with thousands of sentences, you start to run into performance issues because you are doing the procedure one at a time, and you also don't really know what's going on because there's no feedback. The functions below modify the above procedure a bit and basically asks your computer to use multiple processors, and it also provides a little progress bar. Finally, instead of using the very small model that we used above, we are now going to use a slightly bigger model called `en_core_web_md`, this will hopefully help us find more locations!"
