President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year

Like him or not, he did help transform this school. Applications to JMU have drastically increased under this leadership.

Massive changes happening at JMU this year. Alger stepping down, AD Bourne retiring, Cignetti left for IU job, and rumor is Basketball Coach Byington is going to accept the WVU job

Rather short tenure as JMU presidents go. He falls under second-shortest tenure, having stayed for longer than Burruss, but shorter than Rose. I remember when JMU used to have a reputation for presidents with very long tenures, as Duke, Miller, and Carrier all stayed for 20+ years. Rose and Alger both had much shorter tenures than I had expected.

He was very nice and friendly when I spoke to him- enjoyed being a student under his presidency, even if he did look a lil robotic ;)

He started at JMU my freshmen year . He lasted a long time!

Does this mean SpringFest can come back!? üöÅ üî• üõãÔ∏è

Feels like a step sideways

I go to AU lol I came here to ask, was he a good president? Sylvia had her own controversies so I wonder if Alger will be received better

Yeah but did he help run a prostitution ring?

JMU and Diverse in the same sentence?!?!

au student here, i hope he is way better than what sylvia ever was

Hey, i‚Äôm an AU student who just got the news. Based off what you describe, he seems like what our school needs (our current president is *very* disliked and blamed for decreases in rank and enrollment). how would you rate your experience?

Also, VP Harper retiring. VP Moore is in her first year in role.

To be fair, Rose worked his way up the ranks for 23 years before taking the presidency for another 14.

Pretty unique JMU's presidents have stayed so long (lowest with Burruss), considering the average university president tenure is a little less than 6 years

Long tenure + little growth ‚Äî I wouldn‚Äôt consider this a good combination

Yeah same here. He seemed kind of awkward from a distance, but every time I talked to him on campus he was really nice. Spring Break 2023 my mom came to visit on the first day and we walked around campus and ran into Alger and he talked with us for like 30 minutes.

Are you referring to this event? https://www.jmu.edu/news/2010/04/09-springfest.shtml Also, don't forget that this is a college town, i.e. the population turns over relatively quickly. If an event doesn't happen and stays gone for a few years, it is de facto extinct, because the people that remember it are all gone, and the people that are there now don't know anything about it because it was before their time. If it hasn't happened since 2010, it's as good as extinct (today's seniors were eight years old in 2010), and that's not necessarily a bad thing.

Probably higher salary, he was at 570k at JMU, heard American paid their president 1M

It sounds like it is still a step up for him, and in a direction that he's wanted to go for a while. Here's what he said in his letter to alumni: > I always tell our students to ‚Äúdream big,‚Äù and this upcoming transition now represents a dream come true for Mary Ann and me. American University has an academic profile that mirrors my deep interests in national and global policy, public service and law. Mary Ann and I met just down the street from American University at National Presbyterian Church, which was where I proposed to Mary Ann, where we were married and where our daughter, Eleanor, was baptized. Mary Ann and I both lived in the Washington metro area for over a decade as we were beginning our professional careers and we have always maintained close professional and personal ties there. It is as though our lives are now coming full circle.

Apparently Showker was involved in that too

I was going all the way back to Carrier. Who was Pres when I went

Wait, what? Do tell...

Diversity is far more than just race, ethnicity, or gender.

Sylvia drove this Uni into the ground. I hope President elect Jon Alger can help us

AU and JMU are pretty different schools and cultures, so its tough to tell. I think he is a good guy and president, others disagreed. Though during his time at JMU, JMU moved up to a R2 research university, sports teams improved greatly (part of that can be attributed to Jeff Bourne), total enrollment increased 15%, and total applications increased greatly. Part of the application increase can be attributed to sports success, but he lead our transfer to a better conference. Looking at your old president's resume, he has way more experience than her and is more academically qualified.

Though I doubt an admin change will drastically change a students experience, I do think it will help the school's finances and applications. Kind of surprised American has decreasing applications, it seemed to have a good academic rep

Really? Interesting. Why so disliked and why blamed for the drops? Did she start new policies that led to that

Interesting. I never realized that university presidents typically change jobs that often. I wonder how much that comes from fickle boards vs. changes in opportunities.

Absolutely. It was a wild time. Seen on National news outlets. May be best to be left in the past

I remember being there on shrooms. What a time

570k in Harrisonburg is like 2 million in DC

yeah sure it is definitely much more than the copy paste white frat boy how could i forget the copy paste white sorority girl

As a an alumni the only thing I remember about the handling of JMU that affected me was forcing us to come back to campus during covid before vaccines were a thing to force us to pay to live in dorms and go to in person classes. I'm not saying it was his decision to bring us back but I still can't forgive the school and by extension Alger as the face of JMU for putting me in harms way.

It dropped out of the top 100 in U.S. News rankings, which I think has had a noticeable impact on applications. Only to #105, but "top 100" has a prestige thing to it, especially for students who would be paying for a fairly expensive private school. Academic reputation is fairly good, especially for any major that's DC-related (politics, international relations), but it's a very uneven R2 research-wise, strong in some areas and weak in other areas. The STEM programs being small hurts rankings I think, because STEM programs usually do better in some of the metrics like grant money, paper citations, and average alum salary.

Yeah man, higher-ed presidents are turning over like no one's business. I'm honestly surprised it wasn't brought up more during the ivy league kangaroo congress hearing.

Absolutely for the best to leave it in the past. I was around for the similar event that happened in 2000, though I did not attend the event. It dominated the headlines for much of that year, and the whole thing was so dumb. The event should have never happened in the first place, though it was a traditional thing back then, and just about everyone involved handled it extremely poorly.

Here's the first one without the paywall: https://archive.is/wRp46 That said, wow.

Sounds like you survived

I had a similar experience. Overall, I think he was okay, but I wasn't happy with the way he handled pandemic protocols.

Alger‚Äôs response to hitting over 500 cases in a week

Fun fact, this is sized perfectly to be an iPhone wallpaper

I think we should start posting shit up around campus

Classes are online now. I‚Äôd like to think Alger saw this and it pushed him to make the decision. You‚Äôre welcome.

You‚Äôve officially won JMU Reddit lmao

Lmao, I saw this meme just now right after THE email got sent. Ironically it‚Äôs still accurate üòÇ

Three of them side by side are gonna make a great Zoom background.

Virginia schools be like

VT actually has way more but they are reporting the number to the student‚Äôs hometown instead of VT/Blacksburg case numbers. It‚Äôs messed up

UVa doesn‚Äôt start classes for another 2 weeks, so they have over 100 reported cases without any students living on campus yet

GMU student here. We almost certainly have cases, GMU's doing pretty much nothing to enforce the regulations and the COVID test they made everyone take turned out to be unreliable garbage.

This is bullshit tbh

VCU all virtual until at least March Not sure how to feel about that

And likely all 500 will survive and move on with life. This entire thing is overblown.

Gmu‚Äôs pushing boosters and we still have a petition to go virtual

Seriously? I had no idea. My sister goes to tech currently and we‚Äôve been following their numbers but I guess they‚Äôre totally skewed

Can I find out more about this somewhere?

That shit should be illegal

Uva starts in person class next week. Freshman move in starting tomorrow. But yeah 100 cases and no freshman is not a good sign

Thanks haha

Bruh. Shit still don‚Äôt mean we have cases. Most GMU students commute or sit in their dorms all day and with this pandemic that‚Äôs being done ten fold. Even if Kallaco is absolute shit (the same company VCU uses btw) I highly doubt GMU has many cases cause most of the students here are like wet fucking bread.

Not an actual source or anything but this was on tech‚Äôs Instagram story the other day: https://i.imgur.com/UxEOcMJ.jpg

Yes thank you for the correction, I was remembering that they delayed classes starting for 2 weeks from their original semester start date. Just trying to delay the inevitable I suppose

I see plenty of people going out every single day, and a decent amount of them without masks.

Oh. This doesn‚Äôt seem like something Tech is doing wrong. How could they be reporting numbers for tests they don‚Äôt conduct?

You don‚Äôt have to wear a mask if you‚Äôre outside and doing proper social distancing. And going out where? To class? To work? How the fuck you know where they‚Äôre going and what they‚Äôre doing?

True but I think the point is that JMU is including self reported cases in their grand total on their dashboard, but tech isn‚Äôt. So claiming that tech is doing better than us is incorrect since tech isn‚Äôt including the same numbers that we are. Almost 70% of our cases are self reported, so it‚Äôs safe to say that VT‚Äôs actual number of students with the virus is wayyyyy higher

GMU student here but not on campus this semester. They go outside to socialize, walk around, go off campus, go to dining halls, dorm study groups. Also masks are required everywhere on campus even outside.

Def agree with you - I noticed that immediately on their dashboard and I was like oh that‚Äôs convenient that they‚Äôre leaving off all self-reported cases.

Has Tech said they aren‚Äôt reporting self-reported cases? I haven‚Äôt heard one way or the other.

I think people are also forgetting that GMU students love going to Arlington and DC on the weekends (no masks, bc drinking obviously).

Self reported cases = positives from off campus testing. In the screenshot I linked, VT said that they aren‚Äôt including off campus test results on their dashboard.

Not necessarily, I‚Äôve never been to Arlington or DC since I came to mason (same with many of my other friends) and I‚Äôm not from the Northern Virginia. Also that‚Äôs every school that goes to a bar and drinks.

Bro what? I wasn‚Äôt saying ‚Äúall‚Äù of us do, and I‚Äôm well aware that college students like to go out and drink. Just from my observation, a lot of gmu students have recently been going to Arlington and dc on the weekends, regardless of this whole pandemic thing. Same behavior as before COVID, just now more unsettling because nobody prefers masks when they‚Äôre under the influence

Ah ok I was just confused. Yeah I‚Äôve noticed that except they go to like bars in the Fairfax area. I can‚Äôt really blame people for socializing with friends but going indoors with a mask is risking it for others.

The Dukes Advance! JMU defeats Wisconsin to advance to round of 32 to face Duke.

Well-earned. They were the better team all night.

Dominated all game. That was so cool. I went to the game against Indy in 13 and that SUCKED. It‚Äôs took a little extra time but JMU has arrived on the big stage and it‚Äôs been fun.

First tournament win since 1983

It‚Äôs gotta be the purple unis, they‚Äôre so clean.

It was still exciting to just make the tournament, that team was really solid but could not compete on a level with oladipo, zeller (his nba play does not reflect his college, dude was a monster in college), and yogi Ferrell iirc. This years team is on another level in comparison, but I was still pretty surprised how well we played today. On to Duke.

We hit a 3 to start the game and Wisky never even tied it. Wow.

First time reaching the second round since 1983. We won a first four game in 2013

Anything but the black unis, they‚Äôre bad luck

Sure. But that game we never sniffed being competitive. So this was so fun.

took My graduation pictures today while maintaining social distancing

Saw you on the quad in that lmaoooo

If you guys are interested in the entire set, you can see them on my Instagram here: https://www.instagram.com/p/B-Sjs-ZBeDC/?utm_source=ig_web_copy_link

Thats amazing

This is so amazing. I shared this with my group of JMU peeps who all graduated (normally) in ‚Äò99 - hang in there! Go Dukes!

Congrats on your graduation! I hate that this is happening to fellow Dukes, but don‚Äôt let it diminish your accomplishments!!

Awesome!! Congrats

Taking Senior Photos During JMU Construction (2019)

This makes me sad because it won't get the recognition it deserves

My friend and I took pictures in front of Wilson in December. You can't even see the fence in the background.

Damn this is prime content right here!

I'd say having the top post of all time on this sub is plenty recognition enough ;) Seriously though, I never expected this to get even 50 upvotes. Imagine my surprise when I woke up this morning to find that it had over three times that.

Leaving Hburg today, and this‚Äôll be my last impression of this semester lol

It's missing a fire

The new place suits him!

If you want to know what decision to make on anything look to JMU and simply do the opposite. This administration could not pour piss out of a boot with the directions on the heel.

Pure poetry.

A wire fence?

Campus Reopening Plan

Until this moment I never noticed those stupid brown eyebrows. What grey dog has brown eyebrows ffs just make them dark grey

Why have I just now realized that.. XD

JMU vs WEBER STATE 8/30/25 Me and my buddy flew over the game tonight, beautiful evening! First pic is on approach to the stadium and the next few are from just circling around. I hope you enjoy!

Wow I saw y'all- the band director was like "that's highly illegal" after you left. We weren't sure if it was a scheduled part of the game or not.

awesome! about what time were these shots?

I‚Äôm an MRD. I pepped this game!!!!! This is so awesome!! P.S.: my mom said all the cops left when they saw y‚Äôall immediately lol

I thought this was part of the game lol

Just amazing shots thank you so much!!!

Lol, I‚Äôm an MRD and I saw you guys! We were all going, ‚Äúis that legal?‚Äù

Damn I miss this town.

I got a few pictures of you guys flying over that I‚Äôd be happy to send your way if you‚Äôre interested in them. Also I checked the [TFR map here](https://tfr.faa.gov/tfr3/?page=map) when I saw you guys flying over and didn‚Äôt see a TFR over the stadium. Not a pilot though so I‚Äôm not totally sure. Are TFRs in place over every game always or just over particularly large games?

I recommend not doing that again. Definitely against federal law‚Ä¶ ¬ß 103.15 Operations over congested areas. No person may operate an ultralight vehicle over any congested area of a city, town, or settlement, or over any open air assembly of persons.

Badass pics. Loved seeing you guys up there!

We all saw you guys!

Even if there aren‚Äôt officially restrictions, it does seem unwise. You know they shoot off fireworks whenever jmu scores, right?

I‚Äôd recommend filing an ASRS report anyway https://asrs.arc.nasa.gov

You can‚Äôt do that man. They have TFRs over the stadium during games

This is the coolest thing I‚Äôve ever seen

Landing on the field would be easy, taking off again not so muchüòÇüòÇ

Not technically illegal as long as you don‚Äôt fly directly over the stadium at low altitude. Definitely not a scheduled part of the game lol. When we were getting ready to take off we usually talk about where we‚Äôre gonna fly and one of the guys that lives next to the airstrip said I think JMU is playing tonight so we got amped up about flying over the gameüòÇüòÇ

7:52 to 7:55pm approximately

I‚Äôm glad you enjoyed it! We classify as ultralights so we don‚Äôt fly with transponders or identifiers so unless those cops knew us personally by wing color or could somehow pinpoint where we takeoff and land from they wouldn‚Äôt be able to do anything about it anyway. FAA has jurisdiction on anything in the air and they‚Äôve never bothered us before

According to previous comments apparently not? Idk and idc it was a freaking awesome evening

Definitely interested in those pics, I didn‚Äôt see a tfr either. However according to what I read after looking it up it does say FAA mandates automatic 3NM 3k feet tfr‚Äôs for any NFL, MLB, D1 football, nascar, Indy car events etc from 1 hour before to 1 hour after the event which I wasn‚Äôt even remotely aware of. The more you know right?

https://preview.redd.it/2buyg15txemf1.jpeg?width=4284&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa12f0b4682f49ccb38bf77e36652f7e50c4455e

Awesome pictures thank you for commenting!!!

For stadiums >30,000 capacity, which Bridgeforth isn‚Äôt.

it's technically illegal if you're that low over a congested area (a yellow on your vfr sectional) or an assembly of people, which a sporting event is.

Could you hear the MRDs play from up there?

This is not correct. I‚Äôd encourage you to read more about regulations pertaining to aviation. Paramotoring in part 103 does not give you the right to disregard TFRs and airspace requirements

After sunset.

Isn‚Äôt that only for events >30k people?

If I took my ear plugs out and idled my throttle mayyyyybe. Motor is really loud when you‚Äôre attached to it so we always fly with plugs. I forgot plugs one time and after a 15 minute flight my ears were ringing really bad

Yeah, I remember there was an incident last year I think where there was an unauthorized drone over the stadium and they delayed the start of the whole game to tell it to leave

Don‚Äôt TFRs only apply to events with more than 30k people?

Like the TFR that specifically applies to stadiums larger than 30k?

Good thing there wasn't a TFR

Ultralights have more restrictive rules than other aircraft. See my post below.

JMU images featured in Daily Show‚Äôs ‚ÄúPandumbic‚Äù coverage

FUCK YEAH BABY! #1 in Covid, we‚Äôll win again next year!

https://www.facebook.com/7976226799/posts/10159240838736800/?vh=e&extid=4bebA5rFy13pW0e8

And the last time we got on the daily show was due to sexual assault, hooray us.

For real though Harrasionburg is rank #1 in virginia for infection rate and new cases per 100k. Harrasionburg is rank #1 for US college towns for new cases per 100k and rank #2 for US college towns infection rate. Go Dukes!

First thing that we see: Wilson Hall. Very nice.

I mean we finally did beat tech though (21-16!) I will say that Stewart went to school in a swamp with one of the higher suicide rates in the country, so his shit talking during that situation felt a bit more biased. I'm not saying anything during that situation wasn't fair criticism btw, just a bit tinged with a W&M superiority complex.

I used this data source for these rankings. [https://covidactnow.org/us/va/county/harrisonburg\_city/chart/5/?s=1019215](https://covidactnow.org/us/va/county/harrisonburg_city/chart/5/?s=1019215)

Well, I know what board I'm on, but there's little doubt that W&M has a much more national and prestigious profile than JMU.

Academically for sure, sadly for us.

Truly a revolutionary concept

Check that. Entire country. Washington Post, ABC TV, etc. all covering the shit show. We've gone national without fielding a team! That's leadership.

I‚Äôm sure your intent was malicious reverse me, however I will have you know that I find this quite funny

lmao yeah you‚Äôre right, the whole state of Virginia is laughing at you buddy. you think putting students at risk of contracting covid-19 is funny? that says all i need to know about you

Oh gee, hope we get our $37 back like we did last year!

Bought mine today, thank god I got the remote parking pass

I understand student frustrations but what about employees who will now get furloughed and will be paid just enough so we can't claim unemployment yet not enough to pay bills and take care of our families!

Lucky for me I‚Äôm still probably gonna use my pass to drive around campus to good longboarding spots. I mean it‚Äôs an expensive solution to it, but at least I‚Äôll use the pass for _something_

Exactly why I park on a close street. No way they‚Äôre going to refund most of that

Unless you are an employee, you didn't pay over $300 for a parking permit. And they are refunding them if you return the permit.

I looked up the parking fee schedule, and I'm kind of impressed by how many different varieties they have now, as well as how many different parking structures they have. I remember when the parking structure behind the stadium was built, and how it was just "the" parking garage back then, because it was the only one.

What class of employee are you talking about?

Hi! Student from GMU here. Never been to JMU's campus but how good are the longboarding spots? Might consider taking a trip down once all the students leave. Is it good for bombing hills or free riding or both? Our campus hills are few and far between and construction has made longboarding on campus a nightmare

An full time annual pass is 300, plus tax. Sweet.

Good reminder. Most faculty/staff found out like students tbh. I get the anger but people need to understand that MOST employees have no say, no control, and are just as angry and concerned.

Bullshit. You could be blind and have seen this coming..

Facilities Management employees!

Most. Average salary of a university employee is far less than you‚Äôd expect. Faculty is a large range. But every day employees are 40k, if that, and many with Masters.

Yeah campus has _tons_ of hills. I‚Äôd say some places are pretty extreme. If you‚Äôre looking for flat areas to practice tricks or cruise or something, DM me, and I‚Äôll give you specific spots. But as a general rule campus is super hilly and has some great spots for downhill work. The quad and east campus are both good downward slope spots. Bridgewater (15 mins south on 42) is a great cruising spot too :)

No tax. No shipping. Just 300.

Faculty here, literally learned about it from the same email everyone else did.

You mean janitor

I don't work at JMU for the money because let's be honest the amount of BS we have to put up with from entitled rich kids who were not taught to treat the "janitor" with the same respect as they treat the CEO is beyond ridiculous I work there because they have amazing health insurance benefits!! And Facilities Management is a huge slew of people it includes your: Housekkeeping staff Maintenance Landscapers Plumbers electricians Recycling workers Waste management / trash workers Pest control of all those people the Housekeeping department get paid the least not even making 25,000.00 a year! and they literally do more then anyone else... those Ladies and few Gentlemen put their lives on the line every day to sanitize and clean things up after students and Office workers! and they are showed the least amount of respect on campus! it blows me away! instead of down grading someone for their job... be happy that the whole housekeeping crew has not up and quit during this whole pandemic! because I can guarantee almost all the housekeeping staff doesn't work at JMU for their "pay"!

Good luck with the transition. I don‚Äôt wish this on anyone having to pivot again.

Who do you think keeps the public restrooms on campus clean enough so you have the confidence to have your ass pounded in them on a regular basis u/ass-pounder3000

I get why the professors can't organize, but are y'all still technically state employees? If not, why not unionize?

we are state employees! I totally wish we could have a union because we would probably all go on strike. It really isn't fair to the other people on campus because alot of times we have issues with our Chemicals not being diluted properly. or there are significant amounts of mold growth, and they expect us to "scrub it away" and the painters to come "paint over it" without fixing the underlying problem.

Collective bargaining is currently illegal for employees of the Commonwealth. It will become legal for local level government employees next year, but it still leaves employees of the state hanging out to dry. It is also illegal for government employees to strike and will remain so after collective bargaining is allowed for local employees next year. Edit: to be more precise, state agencies are not allowed to engage in collective bargaining. That is how the law is actually written.

We did it Patrick! We Re-Opened Campus!

Me when I think about how school is in less than two weeks and I have no genuine clue what is going on

I feel your pain..

I still don‚Äôt

Well that was fast

I miss the Algerdome meme days

Follow the @onlyatjmu account on insta if you wanna see more ager slander

I don't think the picture on the left ever happened. In fact most of you kids on here have done nothing but belittle the man to the point where the jokes are taking on a life of their own and no longer have any context. Maybe he deserves all of this, maybe not, but I have never gotten the feeling that he was revered.

Seriously - what I would do to see those annoying "Algerdome" posts come back.

Well it may have been mostly a meme, but people have been calling him daddy and shit for a while on this sub at least, which is the internet‚Äôs version of reverence lol

I don't think it was reverence, more of a mocking of supposed authority by mutating him from a paternal leadership figure i.e. president to some sort of infantalized parody of the same, esp. by relabeling him with juvenile terms for a father such as "daddy" and juvenile definitions such as "swole","big", etc. - the way a five year old would describe their father. It's pretty much what I'd expect from young people coming to terms with functioning in a society and encountering a figurehead who lacks any direct mandate from the students themselves to lead them(ignoring any supposed mandate from the state that the students almost certainly did not elect or choose), but attempts to lead all the same. tl;dr: students didn't make him president, resent his authority, reduce that to ashes with maymays on the internet because that's the only place they're still free.

yup, it's his face I think. he'd look so much more authoritarian if he just grew a beard or sumn

JMU Nazi Zombies Edit

i heard the social distancing perk helps you go further than 5 days. it‚Äôs 10k points though, so most people don‚Äôt get it.

Yeah this will probably be on jmu barstool soon lmao too good

Avoiding Frat boys in class after they party is the hell hound round

This is honestly the best meme I‚Äôve ever scene on here

Skeleton sound effects from EverQuest.

I feel that

Should‚Äôve spent my points on that instead of the parking pass

Who needs birth control when you have roasted nuts.

I can‚Äôt stop laughing at this comment

Appreciate it lol

Keep your eyes out for itüëÄ

Good question

Oh wow. Thank you! ü•∫

Take it or mail it back to the Parking Office by 9/11 for a full refund.

I am laughing and crying at the same time because of how ridiculous that email was

I recall some number of cases the school would shut down when it hit but I don't remember what it is. Do you happen to know?

I might be wrong but I thought those 189 cases were all cases since July 1st?

probs a typo. supposed to be "new"

I don‚Äôt thing it was a typo. I think they want to emphasis that COVID isn‚Äôt ‚Äònew‚Äô anymore.

Also wear a mask.

What happens to local jobs of the ‚ÄúTownies‚Äù if all of the students go back home?

That post wasn‚Äôt accurate. Just someone misunderstanding something JMU said

This was the clarification: https://www.breezejmu.org/news/interim-director-of-medical-services-describes-trigger-events-for-online-learning/article_89814196-e276-11ea-ae87-439bf0d5f038.html

They are but even last week they were under 20. It‚Äôs rising super fast

Its a way to use statistics to push out a biased message. ‚Äú180 since July 1‚Äù sounds a lot better to a reader than ‚Äú160 in the last couple days‚Äù even though both are true.

The same thing we do when y'all are out of town. We were here first and we'll be here after.

Townie here. We are powered by agriculture and manufacturing and other things. JMU students power JMU, the ever blossoming student housing cities, our bus system & restaurants, some gas and groceries....that and alcohol sales.

I wish you well, neighbor. But if JMU goes under Harrisonburg won‚Äôt recover economically. [America‚Äôs College Towns Are Facing an Economic Reckoning](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-08-21/what-the-pandemic-is-doing-to-college-towns?utm_source=url_link)

Yeah, this isn't really correct. Without JMU we wouldn't have many of the businesses we have here, there would be no transit system to speak of, and a good chunk of the city budget would be missing (because even though JMU doesn't have to pay property taxes to the city, a check is made out to the city every year fro the amount that it would be). The city itself would be hurting, bad, were it not for JMU, there is no way around that. I'm a local that grew up here, I'm heavily involved in the community (including city government), and someone that works for the university. I can say this with absolute certainty that Harrisonburg would not be near the city it is without JMU. Those employers we have here wouldn't be here were it not for them.

If you‚Äôre so dumb that you live in a university town and don‚Äôt think that the university has a significant economic impact, perhaps you need to further your education.

JMU is way too big to fail. They will take your money online. They would certainly be bailed out. It's the American way.

The transit system is a Harrisonburg entity that is also a JMU owned entity that also serves EMU. I don't see it as focused on serving folks in poverty. Also, the student housing is great, but we have almost no affordable housing for low income families available in town, save the Housing Authority housing. JMU Is great in what it does for the town, it is terrible for what it does to lower income households in term of rent and housing availability. I remember well when we sold our town to JMU chunk by chunk, including the High School (and the 2nd and 3rd highschool fiasco), the Co-op, etc. In that respect, JMU has been a glorious profit opportunity for the town. But, we also have industry, and support Rockingham County families as a shopping base. I was replying to the implication that without JMU, Harrisonburg would fold. Certainly the landscape would change, but the businesses that would be hurt would be those businesses that are built for students. I have respect for JMU, I acknowledge on a whole, it is great for business. PS, I circle the same water as you, my friend. Also a local.

It makes you angry I don't drop on my knees and thank you for coming to our little berg? Thank you, young privileged rich kid. We will surely die and wither without you.

I believe you're getting at a critique of JMU that i hold close. The main benefit of JMU is to the businesses and those who own the property around this area rather than the community at large. A corn field being turned into student housing is a great idea from a business perspective, but if it doesn't aid those in need of affordable housing in the area but only further drives up property values it in fact makes it that much harder on those in the community. Land development and flourishing businesses do not equate to the people in most need having their needs met and even works against them by inflating property values to unaffordable rates.

I think you are missing that a lot of the employers in the city would not be here without JMU. Rosetta Stone, for instance, would not exist here without JMU. Lots of businesses exist here because if the talent pool of JMU students or graduates remaining here.

PS: It's been published and no where did I say it would not hurt, but it is far from the only business in town. [https://harrisonburgdevelopment.com/jmu-economic-impact-study/](https://harrisonburgdevelopment.com/jmu-economic-impact-study/)

If you despise JMU and the students so much, why waste your time in this subgroup? I‚Äôm not into pissing contests with people who are intellectually limited. I wish you well, neighbor.

I didn't miss it. Just going for a balanced narrative. These kids (or their parents) are paying big money for the education. Education is a booming business. JMU is generous with their students locally. There are several amazing outreach services JMU brings to the burg, like the suitcase clinic for the homeless. But such big businesses always has costs.

I'm 1. Interested in the COVID outbreak. 2. My son attended JMU (full ride)...and my lord where did I say I despise JMU kids? I have helped teach JMU classes as a guest speaker for the past 6 years. I have had several JMU interns over the years. You shouldn't assume "townie" means Jeff, the beer truck driver. Be well.

This subgroup is part of our town. I do not claim to hate JMU students some of my best of friends have came from there. But you coming in and acting like there would be nothing in Harrisonburg for us without y'all is misled at best and pure misinformation at worst. We can take care of ourselves and we aren't tethered at the hip to this institution. Ultimately JMU needs us, the inverse is not true.

You must think I see JMU as 100% good for the city, which I don't. My point here is that without JMU the city of Harrisonburg would not at all be in the economic state it is in. It would be much smaller, both in population and economic size, and would not have near the number of employers it currently has. This all comes with problems and the externalities could go on and on. My conflict was with your statement that the city is powered by agriculture and manufacturing and that the students only power JMU, and that's just patently false.

Oh no, JMU is definitely the biggest business in town, but I wanted the person to understand, not the only business. The town does have businesses that do not depend on JMU. Certainly the lions share are JMU, but looking at this list...many do not depend on JMU at all. Many are blue collar jobs that are independent of "The Firm". https://harrisonburgdevelopment.com/major-employers/ I didn't know Rosetta Stone was hooked into JMU. They hire graduates, or offer internships?

Rosetta Stone was founded by two professors and the brother of one of them. Without JMU, the business would not be here. Those are the things that aren't accounted for in the economic development numbers.

why do we keep losing coaches?

What‚Äôs with our people being picked up by other schools

He‚Äôll probably quintuple his annual salary, same as Cig. Can‚Äôt blame him for leaving.

Don‚Äôt hate the player, hate the game

RIP? We‚Äôll be just fine

The world where everyone just wants more money is so awesome. I love sports. The fact we spend more on sports than college education is really smart. Who needs books!

Mid-major $$$$

More money and better opportunity. He's done all he can do at JMU.

He‚Äôll still have a losing season candy vandy is the team other teams beat up in the conference it‚Äôs our almost guarantee win good coach or not he just won‚Äôt be able to compete

In a few years he‚Äôll be back at SBC school as an asst. working his way into a HC position. He got Mike London-ed. He‚Äôs in way over his head now.

Because we don‚Äôt pay good coaches like they‚Äôre good coaches

JMU can‚Äôt keep up with the high salary for good coaches.

Yep we offered to make Cignetti highest paid coach in the Sun Belt and IU still paid more than double that

Hopefully, but there‚Äôs always a lot of variables when it comes to a new coach

Vanderbilt will be good when all our players hit the transfer portal‚Ä¶.

Late stage capitalism hits college sports.

Idk l, the expectation is probably pretty low at Vandy so as long as he is consistently .500 and being somewhat competitive in conference play they‚Äôll keep. Plus if Byington ever takes Vandy to the tourney he could probably get a really big time job given his age

And then they move on and underperform. See Mike Houston at ECU

4 times more than that.

Yes, but unlike the past, we‚Äôve got leverage. We didn‚Äôt fire our coach this time, he left for a better school because of how well we performed. There‚Äôs actually incentive outside of money for a coach to come here, meaning we have a leg up on other schools needing a coach for a similar price tag

Cignetti isn‚Äôt winning with JMU players and byington won‚Äôt either. They just bring them with them for depth purposes while they try to recruit higher level talent.

Honestly most our best players or ones who are good enough to play in a power conference are out of eligibility outside of Edwards, but given what he said in his interview on senior day, he may try and go pro

That incentive is using us as a stepping stone to a higher paying gig at another school.

Yeah we could definitely get an assistant from a power conference school or poach a head coach from a good team in a lower conference. I hope we go after Langel from Colgate, he is in a similar position as Chesney was, up and coming and has a shot at Power conference jobs but won in a pretty low level league.

Cignetti has a pretty easy schedule (outside of Ohio State and Michigan) this year. Could probably go 7-5 or 8-4 l, though that will be his peak at IU and if pretty sure their admin and fan base will be ok with that

As a fanbase we are just going to have to accept that until we get into a power conference (if ever given the way college sports is changing)

Cautious optimism.

President Alger has invited you to Newman Lake

This sub has been going off with top tier memes and I love it lol

LMAO this is perfect üòÇ

‚ÄúHere we are safe. Here we are free.‚Äù Are we really though???

Man I was going to do this.

I am honored to accept his invitation.

LUCI UPDATE: SHE‚ÄôS HOME :) Had a convo with the bushes, turns out she was listening too :))))

Glad to see she made it home safely!

Haven‚Äôt had any info to provide so I haven‚Äôt commented yet, but I‚Äôve been closely following your search. So glad you found her! Congrats!!

I was just thinking about this before I went to bed last night‚Ä¶ lol. I‚Äôm glad you finally found her!!!

I bet your neighbors have a panic attack walking by your window and just seeing a pair of legs.

YAY!!! I‚Äôm so glad to hear this!!!

I‚Äôm very glad she‚Äôs back

Yay! Sometimes cats just need a little exploratory trip

Happy to see this! I had been checking previous posts for updates!

So happy that you found her, i saw your posts

Awesome news!

JMU Administration has failed you all. I'm an alumnus (from a while ago, but...). Here is what you do, and who you contact, to get REAL consequences for that failure... What has just happened to you all is beyond my imagination. JMU Administration failed you in every way possible. President Alger shouldn't have a job at JMU tomorrow, next semester, next year, let alone past that. But you should not just contact the administration, they already know what they did, and will just do damage control to keep your story from spreading. They're the black hole of your anger and distrust right now. Nothing at all will come out of putting your concerns there. Contacting the media is good to create a baseline set of facts and testimony, but it won't do much other than create a storm for JMU Communications to weather. So, keeping in mind that as tuition and fee-paying students you're actually *kind of untouchable* just as long as you stay calm and keep to the facts of your experience: **(1) Contact the JMU Board of Visitors.** You all need to contact the people that hired the President, approve the budget, and actually control EVERYTHING about JMU, from faculty tenure to dining services contracts to administrative appointments to approval of campus-wide initiatives to...everything: [https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/Contact.shtml](https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/Contact.shtml) The Board of Visitors is who you all need to contact. I wish I'd known that when I went there. Would have saved a lot of time. **(2) File a FOIA Request** Also, especially if you work for The Breeze (or are a student who might have some free time and above-average curiosity) and haven't already, think about keywords used by the administration in reference to the coronavirus planning and response, and then consult this site: [https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/foia.shtml](https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/foia.shtml) ...and then develop and send the relevant VA FOIA request (see "How to: Submit a FOIA Request" [here](https://www.va.gov/FOIA/Requests.asp)) to [foia@jmu.edu](mailto:foia@jmu.edu). They may attempt to make you pay for your university's records about their plans for you, or try to charge you ahead of time to stop your request. Don't pay a dime. If you're a student journalist and using it for those purposes, just say so and argue for an exemption to the cost. If you're not a student journalist, this can still apply to you (see the above "How to: Submit a FOIA Request" site for more information): >Fee Waivers Agencies may grant fee waivers if the requester successfully describes that the disclosure of information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. That's you! Press your rights and get a fee waiver. **(3) Contact the Faculty Senate:** [https://www.jmu.edu/facultysenate/](https://www.jmu.edu/facultysenate/) And ask them (specifically Faculty Senate Speaker [larsenwv@jmu.edu](mailto:larsenwv@jmu.edu)...sorry Val, it's most certainly not your fault this happened!), or create a student petition to ask them, to call for a full and secret-ballot faculty vote of (no) confidence in President Alger. That will also get the BOV's attention, even just as a potentiality.

Don‚Äôt be fooled. Everything Alger does is in consultation with and with the blessings of the BOV.

As a short addendum to the FOIA bit, keep in mind when reading this: >(2) educational, noncommercial scientific institutions, and representatives of the news media are charged for photocopying, after the first 100 pages; ...that these are the charges you'll likely get an exemption from, as described above. But even that exemption is largely unnecessary, because: A LOT of the records you'll be seeking are not paper records. They are just emails or Outlook meeting subjects/notes among administration, or digital server files that might contain your listed keywords. At JMU the shared file drive is the [N:Drive](https://www.jmu.edu/computing/communication-and-collaboration/network-file-storage.shtml). So, journalist or not, make sure you ask for relevant documents from the email server (I believe this is exchange.jmu.edu, but perhaps consult IT for what to call it, I bet they'd help) and the N:Drive in your request for searches. You should not accept charges for access to those documents as they would result in no photocopies. If for some reason they attempt to charge you for physical documents, amend and resubmit your request for ONLY digital documents on the mail server and the N:Drive.

If that is the case then you will need to hold the governor accountable. The nice thing about FOIA requests is it makes the internal BS the university pulled public record. This makes it so everyone knows who is responsible for each decision that lead up to this mess.

I was coming here to say this. Alger certainly is culpable, but he also would be an easy fallman for others higher ups to hide behind. Don't be satisfied with just *his* head.

Uhm how about by not baiting and switching the students and sticking all the people off campus with a lease that they don‚Äôt need now!

It's not a little college. It's a mid-to-large sized university Other colleges and universities in Virginia have not done nearly as poorly. Compared to other public universities in Virginia, JMU has stagnated a bit. For example, VCU and CNU used to be placed people transferred to JMU from. Now they're basically peer institutions. VCU has passed JMU for some majors. JMU is still a very good institution. I am happy to hear about the scholarship aspect, if true. The JMU administration has negatively impacted all their students' lives, and given JMU a black eye that will last for years. So even if you think they've done a great job up until now, they had by far the worst "plan" in the Commonwealth and they squandered all the gains you think they deserve credit for.

Dude, did you really expect any college to continue with zero cases? Blaming the students for a highly contagious virus? The faculty knew about this and said they would keep in person classes so they wouldn‚Äôt lose half of their tuition. It‚Äôs so obviously a bait situation brought on by the schools financial greed.

It‚Äôs greed because of the way they went about it, they knew in the summer that this was going to be the plan. They lied and told students there would be in person classes to keep attendance up. Now anybody with an off campus lease is stuck paying a lease for a building that really isn‚Äôt of any use. Good for you on your full scholarship, but you‚Äôre not thinking of the people locked into leases and on financial aid. You haven‚Äôt gone here one semester yet, pipe down.

>Greed? You MUST mean maintained a stable budget. As a person attending JMU on a full-ride, my education fully depends on us maintaining a balanced budget. JMU has ALREADY had to fire 25% of adjuncts, we are still suffering from the initial quarantine. Further budget cuts result in further job losses for potentially hundreds of people. I don't think it's exactly greed in the sense that Alger is doing this all for his own reasons, but I have trouble with the argument that they needed to do this for a stable budget. Yes, that is a concern, it's still troubling when they do that and effectively fuck over students. &#x200B; I don't doubt that partying and irresponsible student activity contributed to the speed of the spread, but given the situation in the dorms and dining halls as well as crowded classrooms, I don't see how this wouldn't have spread anyway.

They don't *really* have a stable budget, though. JMU has a lot of bond-related debt for capital improvements and other budget items. As noted in their Fitch rating, their AA- (good) credit risk is based on their ability to collect student tuition and fees. They screwed that up by going all cheapskate and incompetent in their COVID re-opening plan, and now who knows what they'll be able to collect in revenue for AY 2020-21.

I love your victim mentality. This is definitely on the admins, other schools are handling this better

I love you both

JMU Alum here, have a daughter on scholly at University of Colorado and one on scholly at University of Mississipppi.........they are both doing fine with hybrid on campus in person classes.

JMU: "Signage will warn students against entry if they are experiencing any symptoms of COVID-19."

Gotta love a big dose of security theater.

That‚Äôs what restaurants and grocery stores are doing. It‚Äôs impossible to police everyone

Sounds about right

I don't envy anyone attending JMU right now.

Wake up people

if it‚Äôs still there tomorrow, i definitely want to check it out lol

When did this happen?

Look into ittttt

Saturday at like 9:30 but the letters in Epstein didn‚Äôt look right so I fixed it at like 10 tonight

It gets painted over weekly lol

i don't think you understand that spreading this 'meme' spreads awareness about the entire story which is a positive for the victims because it gets more coverage, everything doesn't have to be so woke...

*Prison guards have left the chat*

I don't think you understand what he just said. It is spreading the fact that this pedophile was murdered to protect a ring child predators in powerful positions in the U.S. and around the world. Meme or not this is important. Don't be soooo open that your brain falls out.

Duke Dog, obviously.

Lol nice one. I used to work at a sign shop here in town and one of my coworkers told me he used to be the guy inside the Duke Dog costume. We also did repair work on the Duke Dog's prop dog house.

At least they tried. It‚Äôs better than I could do.

It's there, it's just way in the back, past the village

Nope, it's there.

I was just going to tell OP to land on the quad and have a picnic.

It's created by the game algorithmically based on satellite imagery, if my understanding is correct.

I think that the land data is upstream from the game, and where there is incomplete or bad data, they use stock graphics to fill it in. I live in Montgomery County, Maryland, and the buildings there look similar to this, where the game used a lot of fillers. The parking garage near where I work shows up looking like townhouses, and the row of townhouses that I live in near GAI airport looks like an apartment building. But then you go into Howard County, Maryland (the next county north), and the buildings are practically picture-perfect. My SO's parents' neighborhood in Ellicott City is accurate, and so are all of the stores in the shopping centers.

i need more JMU dogelore

Walter was a Duke

Dukes and top dog crushed me

I was so shocked when I visited JMU recently. Had no idea d-hall was on the chopping block. I walked in between Keezel and Carrier and there was an empty void. I have found memories of eating breakfast alone in D-hall and listening to music on my iPod.

IMO new d-hall lost its charm. Probably being nostalgic but I miss the easily available huge tables, and the super generic college food. It felt a lot like an attempt to clone e-hall.

Haven't been back to campus since D-Hall was torn down and replaced. Honestly I was more upset by the loss of Dukes. Either way, despite knowing about the changes, I'm still going to be caught off guard by the new building, I know it.

Met the love of my life there, and now it‚Äôs gone. Coincidence?

How is the new dining hall, btw?

I remember when "Top Dog" was a ballroom. The bookstore used to use said ballroom for textbook sales back when the bookstore was in Warren Hall, before they opened the current freestanding bookstore.

they tore down dukes right as my freshman year started, which sucked because i discovered it on a visit in my sophomore year of high school and ate there every time i visited. it hurt a little to watch it go right when i finally had the opportunity to go often

Woah r u insulting their buff mash? Alger literally is within earshot u idiot

I also loved the fries at Dukes

it‚Äôs pretty nice, but it gets crowded very easily. there‚Äôs a decent variety of food, and a couple stations that change themes weekly

I was sad to see Einstein Bros in that spot, because it used to be a really great sub place called Door 4 Subs.

Dukes and top dawg were the best places to eat on campus

Please tell me that Pukes actually had quality food vs. the slop that they used to serve in the early 2000s.

The design is like a shopping mall had a stroke then had a baby with an airport terminal

Or here is a great response!: https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=q0RPI1qMY10

Someone honestly needs to make a sign that says "Don't feed the troll, keep walking" and stand in front of him. People get into such heated arguments but the truth is he wouldn't be there if people didn't give him any attention.

Where even is bible man

*your attention

THANK YOU he will just keep coming back.

Tf is going on I‚Äôm ootl

He and others like him don't want your attention. They want you to get angry enough that you bump him or otherwise "assault" him. Guys like this one have been the beneficiaries of numerous lawsuits against colleges and students.

Man, I feel like I'm missing out on all the action! (I would've been a freshman this year except I deferred my decision to fall next year)

Fuck off, if I want to argue with angry bible man I will. You do you and I‚Äôll do me.

Oh man, I remember being in school for this. This went viral at the time.

Carrier usually

Edit your post

Middle-aged, evangelist Bible thumpers have been standing on a box in front of D-Hall, telling anyone that isn't "saved" and/or haven't repented for their sins, that they are going straight to hell. It's in The Commons during a school day so it inevitably draws huge crowds of onlookers. There's lots of shouting back and forth but it never really goes anywhere. They love trolling and will go all day. This happens multiple times a year at JMU, but they actually do this all over the country. They've been doing it for decades and will likely continue to do it for decades more.

Huh. Guess Angry Bible Man is a redditor now.

It was just after my 6.5 years at JMU, but I was incredibly proud when I saw it!!

One one hand, there are so many sick students. On the other hand - we need your money. Let's stay optimistic we can do it all.

Why wouldn‚Äôt you look at all the numbers so you can get a complete picture? Just looking at the number of cases means nothing when its not compared to anything such as percentage asymptomatic and symptomatic, number of hospitalizations, deaths, etc.

Yes it is an important indicator but it means nothing when looked at by itself. If the whole world gets a disease but no one dies or goes to the hospital, then the number of cases doesn‚Äôt mean much, does it?

Obviously knowing how many people have it means more than nothing. I never said it wasn‚Äôt. My point is that number needs to be used along with all the other data, which nobody does and apparently y‚Äôall think is stupid for some reason. And to your point on demographics, our age group besides kids has the lowest death rate yet everyone is acting like coronavirus is automatic death.

Thats hysterical because you know nothing about me. Do some research and use some real facts. I‚Äôll leave this here. https://thefederalist.com/2020/10/29/these-12-graphs-show-mask-mandates-do-nothing-to-stop-covid

Happened to me last semester and one of my classes never had enough people register and I had to scramble. The syllabus for each class should be readily available so I can actually plan my semester out before the day of class.

We are the fortunate few without too many classes

Major donor & alum calls for Board to not renew Alger's contract. "He has shown poor judgement, a lack of Leadership, and is hugely uninspiring."

I didn‚Äôt know JMU had the opportunity to meet with the leaders of amazon like GM and VT. This hurts. Throughout HS, I wanted to go to JMU, but since coming here, I‚Äôve seen a terrible lack of authoritative presence. I‚Äôve seen this in one of my gen eds last year where the teacher was accused of title 9, and now this entire shitstorm of a year. I don‚Äôt want to point fingers, but as the president of JMU, he has to set strong precedents and be a role model.

He‚Äôs right. I think this is a major reason that Tim Miller has become a much more prominent voice in JMUs public rhetoric. Alger isn‚Äôt relatable, exciting, or engaging. He‚Äôs pretty clearly a leader who‚Äôs cashing a check and enjoying an early retirement. Frankly his handling of Covid was the final straw, many students, faculty, and admin haven‚Äôt liked Alger for a long time

Did y'all see the article at the bottom of the page. That one is quite the read: [https://www.breezejmu.org/news/alger-moved-jmu-away-from-transparency-skirts-open-meetings-laws/article\_6212c31a-0ef8-11eb-ac23-ab9df12a2bd2.html](https://www.breezejmu.org/news/alger-moved-jmu-away-from-transparency-skirts-open-meetings-laws/article_6212c31a-0ef8-11eb-ac23-ab9df12a2bd2.html)

YESSSSSSSSssss

A "You took the words out of my mouth" pat to Mr. Tickle for speaking up for alumni everywhere... preach 'Being the Change', while missing the opportunity to step up when things get hard. We can do better.

When does the contract expire?

Hugely uninspiring is the best way to describe him, wow.

Alger is robotic and scripted in almost everything he does. He is not personable nor relatable at all. His videos and speeches are beyond boring, makes we want to go to sleep, does nothing to energize JMU. He just does what he is told and like others said collects his paychecks. Tim Miller would certainly do better from an interpersonal standpoint. Most people I know at JMU either love Tim or hate him, to each their own.

I really don't know much about the power distribution at JMU or American universities in general, but isn't the president just a figurehead, or does he actually have real power?

It‚Äôs really not his fault, he‚Äôs the face of JMU and has to do what the investors say. The investors/visitors suck tho

I know people aren‚Äôt happy with the administration. But this is so coordinated...reeks like political hit job.

sounds like a real tickle pickle

Was it Dr Pappas? I never had him but my roommate did and he sounded weird. I heard there was a shitstorm with him last year regarding title IX

Adding one more comment: JMU does nothing to help students post grad. I‚Äôve heard many more cases from VT and GM of the school taking a vested interest in finding gainful employment for students post grad. JMU does not do this. You walk across that stage and you‚Äôre on your own.

As a sophomore, I feel like Tim Miller is a lot more approachable and engaging than Alger. I‚Äôd much rather see a person like Miller in charge than deal with a president who clearly doesn‚Äôt go live a shit about the students, but that‚Äôs just me

I've been saying this about Alger since he was inaugurated. I have never liked him and I absolutely do not like the direction JMU is heading. I'm so glad people are finally speaking up about this.

Tim Miller would potentially do better from a PR standpoint, but not from an interpersonal one if we're talking about his colleagues. The people who love him are the people who spend time with him socially - he's a super dynamic and charming guy. The people who have to work with him and whose jobs are affected by his decisions.....much less so.

I believe so. His name was never mentioned, however the details in the breeze article as well as his... personality quirks shall we say combined with his abrupt departure from JMU despite making well over a 6 figure salary leads me to believe it was him. Their name in the article was never released however I could not and have not found any class that remotely resembles the one in which he taught

Yep. I had trouble finding employment and reached out to the career center and they basically told me ‚Äúsucks to suck‚Äù

Yeah man I believe it. Graduated two and a half years ago and the only times I‚Äôve heard from JMU is when they‚Äôre asking for money

It really hasn‚Äôt changed since then. I graduated in 2018 and there was absolutely no help from the school. Two months after graduating, jobless, with student loan payments kicking in soon, JMU started asking me to donate. I do believe I wouldn‚Äôt have my job now without my JMU degree, but I think it‚Äôs an important warning to any current students to start looking for employment like a year before you graduate. JMU has no interest in making you employable. Frankly, I think they quite like undergrad students that take an extra semester or two

I had him back in 09 I believe. Total nut case. Took a weird 400 level class with him in ISAT that was super meta and philosophical. Can‚Äôt remember it much now but he had a couple female pets as TAs.

He was an ISAT professor I believe. It's pretty obvious to anyone who had him that he's the professor accused of sexual harrasment mentioned in this article [https://www.breezejmu.org/news/sga-senator-files-bill-of-opinion-after-experience-with-title-ix/article\_a403017c-5387-11ea-ad4e-7764d41099d1.html](https://www.breezejmu.org/news/sga-senator-files-bill-of-opinion-after-experience-with-title-ix/article_a403017c-5387-11ea-ad4e-7764d41099d1.html)

I don‚Äôt disagree with you at all but it‚Äôs important to note that every student should be looking for jobs a year before they graduate. Maybe the importance of that wasn‚Äôt made clear to you during your time there, and that‚Äôs a shortcoming of your professors if so, but that is exactly what every student should be doing. Waiting until you graduate or are close to graduating to start the job search is a mistake.

u/FriedButthole u/MagicJasoni I'd really like to hear more about this, since I spent all of last summer working as a student assistant producing a study advising the future direction of our career center, now called the University Career Center. From the 2000s on, we've offered career services to alumni up to a year after graduation, and now it's two years. I know that isn't a very long time, so extending that offer for five or ten years or indefinitely might be of significant use to alumni, but what else were you looking for as a recent alum that the career center could've helped you with? We really, genuinely want to do better.

I had his class in 2014. He was well known for surrounding himself with beautiful young women and being inappropriate in his conduct towards them. Things like inviting them out to drinks at the Dodger ‚Äúto discuss research‚Äù.

They really need to cancel classes for a "professional development day" during the semester. Give everyone a full day to attend career fairs, attend workshops, and otherwise get their house in order. The number one reason I didn't go to any of the career fairs was because of time. There's a lot of prep work in terms of finding clothes, getting a haircut, ironing, putting a resume and portfolio together, etc. before you even get your foot in the door of the ballroom. And that's even before trying to debate whether you should miss a class or see if you can squeeze some time in between.

I still have all four of my D-Hall "recycle" mugs. These are the 1999, 2000, 2001, and 2002 designs.

I still have my OG "R mug" from 1992.

Two of those are older than I am, bruh üòß

tryna part with the first one?

Maybe I‚Äôm partial because of my birth year but that ‚Äò99 one is so cool

I wish I kept mine!

I wish I still had mine! I had the 99 one!

I think I still have two 2004 and 2008 maybe.

If you're in an overcrowded classroom, TAKE PHOTOS. If administration tries to blame students, there needs to be proof they didn't do everything they should have. Same with dining halls. Same if you see long lines to get tested. Document it. Many administrators at other schools are blaming students for outbreaks and closures. There needs to be evidence to show administration's failings if JMU tries this. Edit: **Post photos to [http://imgur.com](http://imgur.com) then link in the comments here**, but please cover up your professors and and fellow Dukes so they aren't identifiable. If your prof is encouraging students to *not* distance, then that's another thing.

Very good point. I wonder if there‚Äôs a website or an archiving type of place we can upload, with the date, to show what is actually going on. However, I do have a concern about this which is the faculty getting into trouble for doing the best they can. I have a lecture in Madison union where the available chairs for sitting are only 3 feet spaced out, and I wouldn‚Äôt want that to fall on the Professor for something out of their control.

[harrison 2105](https://ibb.co/hcSDqkJ) i was one of the first people here, so it hadn‚Äôt filled up yet, but it DID. they only restrict every other chair. and if y‚Äôall have EVER been in 2105 you KNOW HOW TIGHT IT IS. literally just writing on the desk i was touching the back of the girl in front of me. we‚Äôre gonna die ‚ù§Ô∏è

You're doing some good work here. And I'll echo the concerns other people have about not trying to get people that don't make policy in trouble, but it appears you have acknowledged that and this seems like a great move.

The Wilson Hall Auditorium literally has tape on every other seat and every other row blocked off. no chance for social distancing in there. [https://imgur.com/VEkFYpc](https://imgur.com/VEkFYpc) Edit: Luckily for us, there were only around 90 people in the auditorium Wednesday.

Dining halls, shoulder to shoulder.

&#x200B; |My students are split in half (150 instead of 300) and are seated in Wilson with almost 6 ft apart. ||| |:-|:-|:-| |||| ||||

Question: what is this ultimately going to accomplish? Ultimately, the administration sets the narrative, and should JMU close the campus, whatever JMU's media relations department sends out is what's going to get covered.

Is the outcome going to be different if the students are to blame or the admin? Everyone goes home regardless and whatever $$$ is refunded (if any) will be refunded. Are we just looking for bragging rights here? The virus doesn‚Äôt care about any of this. If the goal is to get the admin to change policies so maybe the virus can‚Äôt spread ok. But blame for blame‚Äôs sake just seems kinda pointless.

This is very considerate. At the same time, profs are doing their best in the new teaching spaces, set ups, etc. It‚Äôs not on them if their classrooms aren‚Äôt conducive to the admin‚Äôs ‚Äúmessaging‚Äù‚ÄîI actually think profs would encourage this archiving.

Yes - please don‚Äôt put your faculty in positions to be in trouble. As a faculty member I can acknowledge that most of us fought VERY HARD to not have this be the reality. We did not want to teach in face shields and behind glass podiums. We wanted to teach safely in a way that was engaging. Many faculty do not teach in their own buildings and have no control over what room the registrar‚Äôs office assigned them to teach in. We‚Äôre trying.

I suppose, post them in the comments here? I'll edit the OP Good point, either try to take a photo without the prof in it, or cover them up before posting it. We should probably cover up the faces of our fellow Dukes too

Reddit...? Imgur? lol

That classroom is the worst. I dont doubt it for a second.

You couldn‚Äôt possibly take a worse photo. So you get there early...wait and take it when the room is full?

ISAT has tons of spacing

Well even if you get it, there‚Äôs a really small chance you get hospitalized, let alone die. But I see what you‚Äôre saying

What is it going to hurt?? Worst case scenario, you have documentation of a specific situation that you were in, that you never use. Without it, the worst case scenario is that the university finds a way to reject a refund because students didn't follow the requirements.

I guess people just don't want to be blamed for something they don't see as wholly their fault. It'll be a hard fight but it seems people want to try.

Yeah, I don't see the point in this, either.

Yes. And they are probably photographing it as well.

I appreciate what you and the rest are doing. I can‚Äôt imagine how hard it must be to have to change habits like walking around a class, approaching students, even classroom setups...I‚Äôm sure it‚Äôs really difficult for you all as well.

aight don‚Äôt be an ass i wasn‚Äôt expecting to need the picture for anything

I absolutely hate this rhetoric. Regardless of how severe it is for younger people, you don't want them passing it on to community members, family, friends, etc. who may actually be affected by it. Regardless of even that, we don't know what the long term health effects of this illness is. Younger people who contract COVID and are "fine" might suddenly begin to develop heart problems, lung problems, OR ANYTHING ELSE in a few years. We could be riddled with invisible illnesses for the rest of our lives. You're not invincible just because you're in your 20s, so stop acting like it.

i have severe asthma, but thanks for dropping in

The chairs are still like 2 feet apart?

It's not going to necessarily hurt, but I don't think that it's going to help anyone, either. But if it makes everyone feel better, even though it's not going to accomplish anything beyond making the people taking the photos feel better, then knock yourselves out.

I've noticed that, in general, once someone puts a post in the negative, it becomes a pile-on. Once a post is negative, it makes people feel more comfortable downvoting it themselves, driving it down even further. More specifically to this subreddit, anything that doesn't subscribe to the doomer mentality that the JMU administration is a bunch of corrupt bastards who are going to take your money, close the campus, and then blame the students for the whole situation tends to get downvoted heavily. I admit that as someone who graduated 17 years ago, I'm probably a bit older than most people on this subreddit, and have been out of the JMU bubble for a while. I've also taken a very dim view of many of the official reactions to this pandemic that we find ourselves in, and believe that the response will ultimately go down in history as a massive blunder. It's a shame how much people aren't willing to hear out other perspectives on here and actually have a reasoned discussion.

Yep - it's going to make them feel better or morally superior, I suppose, but don't expect anything more to come out of it than that.

Yeah got it. I was replying to ‚Äúwe‚Äôre all gonna die‚Äù. I know it was just an expression, but my point is that we are all, in fact not going to die from this :/

When your "other perspective" is repeatedly "just let the virus run its course and kill people", you can expect downvotes from people who have more empathy than a crouton.

I agree it's probably not going to do anything but if pushing back against the administration's narrative is cathartic for them I guess it's better than nothing.

Let‚Äôs say (hypothetically) that only 2 people from JMU die/get serious complications from COVID. Is it really worth the *lives* of those 2 dukes for the rest of us to get a subpar semester of education?

Oh yeah because no one has EVER used hyperbole on the internet.... Also if we're really going to get into semantics and rhetoric on a Reddit comment, the quote was "we're gonna die" not "we're all gonna die".

History 101. A lot of people were on webex.

Absolutely, positively, hell no. I am very much a leftist, but I disagree with the official response to this pandemic, which has turned everything on its end unnecessarily.

Absolutely not. The only reason I responded was because I‚Äôm tired of seeing this propaganda that we‚Äôre all going to die. It‚Äôs a pandemic, not the apocalypse. That being said, we should try our best to keep deaths as low as possible by any means necessary

Sure, but SchuminWeb's in particular usually boil down to "let the virus run its course", check his comment history in this sub. I was making a reference to that perspective specifically.

Exactly, it‚Äôs not propaganda nor is anyone saying we‚Äôre all gonna die, but it sure as hell isn‚Äôt fun and needs to be taken seriously. I used to be in the same boat as you, until I lost two family members to it and very nearly a third. We aren‚Äôt saying everyone is gonna get it super bad, but we need to make sure those who die don‚Äôt just become another statistic. They‚Äôre people.

Damn I‚Äôm really sorry to hear that. I can see how that would change your opinion of the whole thing. I‚Äôm really sorry for your losses üôè

JMU PUTS 70 ON UNC

It was a pretty crazy 1st half. And overall who would have ever picked over an over/under of 119? go Dukes!

Dukes scored 10 more points today than FSU has scored this season in 4 games.

If you didn‚Äôt read JMU‚Äôs email‚Ä¶ here‚Äôs a shortened version ‚ÄúHey‚Ä¶ we realize COVID cases are wildin rn üòù because of this‚Ä¶ we are gonna have higher cases and that‚Äôs ok! y‚Äôall are gonna get COVID‚Ä¶ but it‚Äôs ok üíñ we must learn to live with us all getting COVID‚Ä¶ üòò so in an effort to all give you COVID, boosters aren‚Äôt required if you‚Äôre eligible and for on campus students if you have COVID, just stay in your room! Because that will stop you guys from going about, right? üòä well happy hunger games guys and may the odds ever be in your favor, send us pics of your positive test when you get one!‚Äù

I 100% expected this but the fact that they are leaving absences up to professors is kinda messed up. Especially when there are professors that only give you 1 or 2 absences during a pandemic.

The fact that Alger also said "We have absolutely zero evidence of in-class transmission" is hilarious. How did they even collect that data or quantify it? He could have just as easily said, "We are also absolutely unsure if Covid was transmitted throughout any class across the campus this semester"

Don‚Äôt forget to tag your positive COVID results with #jmucovidchallenge2022 !!

This was exactly how I read it except this was much more fun

i‚Äôm fine with this honestly, if the school actually pushed for policies that would actually keep everyone from getting covid, nobody would like or enjoy school

For the alumni in the group, could you please post the original email as well?

Blame Youngkin and the hayseeds who voted for him .

I respect them respecting our autonomy. If you‚Äôre concerned about the virus get the booster, if you think it works, what‚Äôs the concern?

Alger dropped this thinking that we think he has the conch shell and will therefore listen

Not to mention they stopped requiring unvaxxed people to get tested...

Yeah it‚Äôs the fact that the attendance policy hasn‚Äôt changed that is truly bothering me as like you said many professors have pre-pandemic like attendance policies.

We are trying to address this and get some consistency in how absences are managed. Each professor controls this for their classes so it's hard to make this happen universally but we are trying.

Can't have evidence of transmission if you don't require testing for everyone. Pro move.

Can‚Äôt have evidence you don‚Äôt care to look for.

It's undeniable, especially considering the fact that not everyone wears their mask properly, if they wear a decent mask at all (no, bandanas aren't masks people).

And, remember, the whole point of JMU is to enjoy it. Learning is for those other places that rejected our applications!

same, just get boosted and wear a mask and you should be fine. obviously breakthroughs will happen but the *vid* is probably on its way to becoming an endemic and is just something we'll always have to live with.

[here you go](https://www.jmu.edu/news/2022/01/10-plans-for-spring-semester.shtml) its on their website

The vaccines and the boosters do work in that they **reduce** risk of illness, especially serious illness. They do not eliminate it. Most importantly, hospitals are filled to the brim right now, meaning people that need medical care for other issues can't get the help they need. Selfishness is largely why this pandemic has been so devastating, and gone on for so long.

I‚Äôm not concerned about me getting Covid. I‚Äôve gotten it before and it didn‚Äôt hit me hard. What I‚Äôm concerned about is getting covid and then bringing it home and killing my parents, you dense idiot. What do you think will happen when things get out of control on campus? Everyone will be sent home to spread the virus to their neighborhood. Exactly what happened a year ago. > if you think it works, what‚Äôs the concern? Aren‚Äôt you supposed to be educated? How did you managed to get into college and yet be one of those people that doesn‚Äôt understand what a vaccine is?

Unless I read incorrectly, JMU will continue to provide isolation dorms.

How are you addressing something entirely outside of Student Affairs? What steps can you take when it isn't your department?

My double layered bandana that covered the entirety of my beard says otherwise, including wrapped around to my neck.

also remember that you don‚Äôt have to go to jmu if you don‚Äôt like it!

True, but leave out the masks and booster (especially since the vaxes are doing next to nothing now with the new variants - which are the most prevalent strains now)

Why don‚Äôt you get tested before you come home?

My dad is vaccinated and has his booster but COVID can still kill him since he's in remission from cancer.

‚ÄúSome of you may die, but that is the ri$$$k I‚Äôm willing to take‚Äù

Me every day this past week

Incorrect. There are more black squares

Justice Studies Prof Died of Covid 3 days ago Dr. Terry Beitzel passed away on the 29th of January due to COVID complications. I‚Äôm asking everyone to please take CDC and COVID precautions seriously because we‚Äôve lost a great Duke, teacher, friend, and neighbor. He was only 53 but had so much more to give to the JMU and Hburg community. The most crummy part about all of this is the fact that JMU hasn‚Äôt even sent out a mass email acknowledging his death. Please continue to be mindful and remember that COVID is nothing short of being serious.

Dr. Beitzel wasn't the first member of JMU community, not even the first faculty member, to pass away from COVID and no mass communications have gone out about prior deaths. It's hit the JMU community more than many realize. There have been things on JMU's various social media channels about these instances and some web pages have been created by different departments.

Hopefully they‚Äôll release a statement today. I‚Äôm sure they wanted to communicate with his family about it.

I had Dr. Beitzel last semester- and wow. He was truly an inspirational and caring professor, a rarity it seems in the virtual class setting. He definitely made a lasting influence on me and I'm sure the community of JMU.

I think that, unless the family of Dr Beitzel or any of the other staff/students of JMU request such a mass email to be sent out, we should be sensitive to their loved ones and refrain from broadcasting such things in order to maintain some quiet and privacy for their family.

I can‚Äôt believe this! His gen ed class was the reason I switched to a justice studies major.

Oh wow he was only 53... My condolences..:/

üò¢ Had him way back when for my intro to justice studies course. Rest is peace Terry.

Wasn‚Äôt even aware! Do you know who they are?

Professors within the department have already made it clear that was the cause. There‚Äôs no assumptions.

Dr. Iona Black was the first person I can recall. That was back in August. I have heard rumors of others, but nothing I'd be willing to put out there as I am uncertain. [https://www.jmu.edu/news/chemistry/2020/8-7-InMemoriam.shtml](https://www.jmu.edu/news/chemistry/2020/8-7-InMemoriam.shtml)

Ya I know about Dr. Black but I‚Äôd prefer to stick to factual information over just rumors

Which is why I only mentioned Dr. Black by name.

I don't think that Dr. Black died of Covid. I don't want to speculate too much since they didn't want to release a cause of death, but I was in the last class she taught before she passed (a summer class that June) and she was very clearly deeply unwell.

Cancer not Covid.

I‚Äôm happy to say that I‚Äôm going to be a Duke next year!

Congratulations!! My daughter was accepted today as well! Go Duuuuukes!

Congrats, go Dukes!

Congratulations! You‚Äôre going to love it here!

Congrats! I love your career choice, too.

Congratulations!

I just graduated in 2018. Best decision I ever made in my adult life to go to JMU. You will meet some of the best people this world has to offer when you get there. Orientation feels like it was just yesterday! Congrats!

Yay tell her I said congrats!! Go Dukes!! üòäüòä

Thank you!!

Thank you!! I‚Äôm overwhelmingly excited!

Haha thanks man lmao

Thank you! I‚Äôve talked to a decent amount of people there and everyone seems so friendly I can‚Äôt wait

That‚Äôs awkward

Hey there!!!! See ya soon!

Nah.....he's cool with it - we are all a bunch of weirdos! He's a fellow Duke as well!

course evaluations be like

Well first of all, I have seen bassnecter 67 times

If they don't offer evaluations and you feel like something needs to be addressed, send an email to the Associate Dean. They take this stuff seriously.

I think it depends on the department, some do some don‚Äôt

Housing Info I spent some time going through and taking some notes on the dorms and what they have/don‚Äôt have as well as what I like and don‚Äôt like (hence the highlight colors) here‚Äôs these lists just in case anyone needs it.

Goated analysis

Do not live in Eagle. There is no air conditioning, the rooms are tiny, mold everywhere and I was constantly sick, elevators broken often, the list could go on

Bro, jennings hall style isn't traditional hall style, so I feel like that's worth distinguishing. It's 3 bathrooms per half-hallway that, once locked, it's effectively your own bathroom for the time you're in there. I think the official name is pod bathrooms. Also 1st floor jennings has weirdly tall ceilings. They've also had the nicest wood floors I've experienced.

Wayland does have air conditioning. One thing to note re bathrooms: with hall style bathrooms it‚Äôs common to get to know more people throughout the dorm but with suite style bathrooms, it‚Äôs more common to only really get to know people within your suite. Of course personality plays into this, but that tends to be the trend.

They still haven‚Äôt put ac in the Village? I lived there 4 years ago lmao

Waylands really nice, especially if you‚Äôre an fine arts major.

Logan and Gifford were wonderful in 2007-2009.

You need to account for location!!! Village gets a huge leg up bc it‚Äôs in the center of campus.

If you don‚Äôt care about location. The back road near the Sheetz, there are 1 and 2 bed apartments. My fwb lived there and it was literally a five to ten minute bike ride to campus.

Is Converse Hall not there anymore?

Would totally recommend east campus! It was great when I lived there! By far biggest rooms and closets! Hall style isn‚Äôt bad and you‚Äôre close to e hall/festival and all the science buildings! Pretty close to UREC too!

are they still doing the forced triples next year? if they are, should defo include that in skyline cons üò≠üò≠ ive never heard good things from forced triples

I lived in Logan my first year and I genuinely don‚Äôt think I could have been happier in another dorm. It was so nice and so close to everything

Closets in Hillside/MGL? We got stand-alone wardrobes when I was in MGL in 2012.

I lived in Hillside my freshman year. Very comfortable and close to everything (on main campus). Would recommend for sure!

Just a heads up. You don‚Äôt pick buildings anymore. You rank by area and are assigned by housing.

Lived in Spotswood, doesn't have A/C, one toilet, one shower, two sinks are shared between two suites of two (lock on each side). Has big basement living room/kitchen. Halls were carpet, but inside rooms was like linoleum (the fake plastic tile looking thing). Small closets behind the entrance door (think you could fit two guys in there max).

What about location pros and cons?

Spotswood is HAUNTED. Did not have a roommate and things would move around in my room when I wasn‚Äôt in there/shower would turn on by itself in the middle of the night SCREECHING from the pressure of the hot water pipe

Chesapeake has suites! Get one!!! They‚Äôre a great option

Chapp the best

Village is the best by far. You get a social aspect that none of the other dorms can compare to. I now live with the guys I met last year. The complaint on air conditioning is also so overdramatic, if you get at least one good fan you‚Äôll be completely fine. I‚Äôm typically always warm bodied and village still felt fine. Just do yourself a favor and pick village you won‚Äôt regret the fun you‚Äôre going to have. Especially because they are tearing down the village dorms and getting rid of the suite style so these next 3 years are the last chances to enjoy it for what it is.

To everyone on here : student loans are predatory . If cash flowing college isn‚Äôt an option then you can‚Äôt afford it

Understood, thank you. Staying away from Eagle üëç

Jennings is top 3 on my list

I‚Äôm so okay with knowing less people when going to the bathroom

Some have AC now I think

The dorms looked dark and small from the virtual dorm tours on the JMU page. The walls also looked a little strange. It‚Äôs higher up on the list than others but there are definitely better looking ones in my opinion. Plus, I‚Äôm a business major so might have to pass on Wayland lol

And also in 1985-8

It is just not available to freshman

Best dorm on campus by far!

Logan is my #1 choice. I really really hope I get that dorm

Same here, Hillside does not have closets still; just wardrobes. Also the rooms are super small OP, idk who said large room or what you were looking at but when I lived there there wasn‚Äôt even enough room to set up a yoga mat on the floor

My note is based on the height of the bed. Some of them pictured could be lifted a lot higher than others.

I mean, I could give my opinion on that, but it‚Äôs not entirely relevant to the individual person. Definitely depends on major and whatnot. I did all of this ‚Äúresearch‚Äù based on what I could see online, as I am an incoming freshman. So I left the rest up to anyone who uses the chart üôÉ

I guess the virtual dorm tours can be deceiving when it comes to size üò™

True, but in todays times, that 4 year degree about $100,000

I give it a week

I hate to say it but I feel like the administration will do all they can to suppress information until the tuition deadline. Just look at that ‚Äúdashboard‚Äù they published. Multiple reasons to be disappointed in JMU these days.

the freshens line was out the door and almost outside today, it even crossed with the chick fil a line..

Genius level display from students today. I'm embarrassed to be a Duke rn

Just looked at the Breeze dashboard and mildly hyperventilated...was not on campus so didn‚Äôt hyperventilate _on_ anyone.

This is exactly what is happening.

I wonder if people will file some lawsuits? If they cancel on the 15th it‚Äôs abundantly clear what‚Äôs going on.

This isn‚Äôt on the students and it‚Äôs not on the staff and faculty who have to work within the constraints administration have put on them.

God I hope so. I also hope the state holds JMU and other VA schools accountable for being so reckless. They forced tens of thousands of students from all over the country to travel into the state and have ignored plenty of reasonable safety precautions. The fact that people are forced to attend in-person just to get credit for participation or to take an exam is inexcusable. If I were still a student, I'd be furious that I was spending all this money and didn't have a say in my own safety. If JMU is truly ready to go online at any moment, then classes should have just started out with that capability built-in and made in-person attendence optional. Needless to say, they won't be getting a dime from me ever again. Unlike most, I didn't have a problem with them charging full price for online classes. The faculty and resources offered still can't compete with other institutions even if classes are remote. The fact that they've buried their head in the sand and forced people into making difficult and potentially life-altering decisions just for PR is disgusting. I have very little patience these days for anyone who makes ill-informed decisions regarding COVID. We've watched the rest of the world manage the virus with reasonable success, but the U.S. can't be bothered to pivot, adapt, and follow the science.

If students and staff stay within the fairly simply constraints there will be less cases. Seeing students playing a 20 person game of mask-less spike ball on the quad, breathing down each other's necks in dining halls, gathering in large groups off campus without masks, etc. shows a lack of common sense and shows yet again that a portion of the JMU community believes that rules do not apply to them.

I agree with you on the spring. It sucked to pay full rates for online learning, but they had a budget and I'm assuming when the budget was made they never even considered a pandemic would happen. But this semester, it's obvious to all of us that a semester cannot last. It's understandable from the university's point of view: years of financially cavalier decisions have forced them to throw current students into this shitshow. This whole situation has revealed what we all already knew, but didn't want to say: the American higher education system is rotten to the core. I am a recent graduate so I won't be suing anybody, but I'm concerned current outraged students will feel taking on an entire university is impossible and choose not to take legal action, which is wholly understandable.

Maybe that terrible video on privilege posted here a few days ago wasn't such a bad idea after all.

Agree with everything but dining halls. Kids gotta eat, it‚Äôs not their fault that the administration has done an awful job of giving them a safe way to get food

The Festival atrium in the early evening on the first day of class, fall semester

I miss coming here before my bio classes ü•≤

JMU is the best

I loved that spot. It (at least used to be) quieter than the rest of campus and the food was great.

You're really good at photography!

this is so pretty

Damn, instant flashback.

What year was this Ben?

I miss it. Graduated in may and during my 4 years it was absolutely an underrated spot

Professor Ill be late to class. The Evergiven is blocking Main St.

I had no concept of how big this boat is until now thank you.

Out of curiosity, genuinely asking. Is this to scale?

@the selfish people who plan to party...

I know this is super serious but this had me laughing with how hard he went üòÇüòÇüòÇ

Anybody know who these dudes are? I mean, how classic is this video?!? You kidding me? The school needs to hire these guys to make PSA's. You have bright future fellows, keep it up! Can't decide who is funnier...Chucky Fucking Cheese or his hype man Roland Bautista... Don't mess with a brotha wearing a Metallica shirt and a spiked wrist band.

I wish they could cruise around student apartments and expell anyone partying.

The biggest benefit for me is that I actually learn in person and not online

I agree that the social aspect is a huge part of college, but at the end of the day students pay thousands of dollars to go here for quality, in-person instruction. Drinking culture at JMU doesn‚Äôt have to go away either. Have a dinner party and get wasted. Go on a hike with a couple friends and shotgun beers at the top. Have a few friends over and play drinking games. Fun can still be had, people are just going to have to adjust. The only type of drinking culture being taken away is massive parties and overcrowded bars. I‚Äôm not saying I don‚Äôt like these things, but being with friends does not have to happen in the basement of a frat. To be clear, in normal circumstances I don‚Äôt care how people spend their time. The main pro for in-person classes is in-person classes. Online classes suck. My girlfriend is in a graduate program here heavy on lab work and moving online will completely water down the very expensive and time intensive program she worked hard to get into. This is a reality for many students. I do agree with you that we will likely close regardless of partying or not. But if there are huge parties and those people continue to interact in the community, when students get sent home, the local Harrisonburg community will have massive spikes in cases. It is not fair for students to use their college town as a playground to do whatever they want. The main people at risk in our area will be locals of Harrisonburg. If someone goes to a 200 person party and goes to the grocery store, they are now putting responsible individuals at risk, regardless of whether JMU closes or not

Appreciate the counter argument, and glad we're in a space where you can make it. I would like to counter, though‚Äîthink of the expense of college (don't even weigh it vs. the return). Just the sheer macro expense of it. Is the benefit to be at school for most students really the social scene? If that's true, is it worth paying many thousands of dollars to have a social scene? If it were, would you be satisfied? Do you have a social scene outside of school? And if not, is it worth paying thousands of dollars to have one at school? Honest questions. I posit here that the point of being in school is not the social scene. It's a really great benefit to be able to connect with peers and learn tangentially and by osmosis from being around fellow students. But I very much disagree that the benefit to be school for most students is the social scene. And for that reason, I don't think a bunch of students trying to get their 'last hurrah' in before the school is inevitably shipped to online only is a worthy reason. You said you're against partying. That's cool, and me too in this case. I just want to respectfully challenge the view that college is about the social scene. That's a luxury that folks don't generally understand they have. The primary reason one is at a university is to learn. And if it's not, what's stopping that person from spending an exponentially smaller amount of money, if any, to have a social scene.

Personally, online learning is kinda trash. Ofc online learning may be way better this semester because they actually had time to create a good plan. Anyways, I totally get that students want to socialize with people but why jeopardize the entire student body just to go to a massive party/parties. I‚Äôd rather continue doing small laidback gatherings than going to parties. But to be fair I do like smaller gathering anyways so maybe I‚Äôm a bit biased there. I would just hate to have COVID potentially spread to high risk people at a higher rate because students are going back to school. It‚Äôs a horrible and unprecedented situation and I just want everyone to be safe (and have some fun ofc)

Left Aid house

JMU on the front page again

So glad the sign is back. It was gone when I left

I picked up a couple of alumni last year that lived there when it was rooms for rent. The women said it was great to go back. The guys let them take a self guided tour. They said yep it's a frat house now. Not going back in lol

Left Aid has been around since I was a student. They took down the sign for a while but I'm glad it's back!

I love that house

Cool house - great name-nice people

It took you that long to see?

Alger has the power of God and anime on his side though

Epic! Hahaha thanks for letting me know that's still going on!

Hey guys, quick psa, I have started to see these on campus. if you do see them take them down they are advertising an actual hate group and should not be on campus

Thanks. We love to see advertisements for white nationalist groups on campus. /s The nerve of some people‚Ä¶

Yeah I just read their manifesto, I feel like I‚Äôm on a list now.

Thanks for doing your part

Anything with "patriot" in the name like that should be a giant red flag.

First I've heard of them...what do they do that is hateful?

between them and the 3%ers in the county, there's a bunch of these groups in the area. always gotta keep an eye out for their bullshit.

Patriot front is the same group that rented a bunch of Penske trucks in Pennsylvania and led a march carrying white nationalist symbols

There was a hate group called red ice or something in hburg. I think they disbanded but I‚Äôm hoping this isn‚Äôt some fuck ass fascist group trying to rebuild it. Thanks for sharing.

Nf scum get the fuck out of our town

And here I was thinking they were just opposing Vladimir Putin like everyone else

I‚Äôve covered one around Harrison and picked off another. Would love to know the extent and times of these so please continue to post where you find

are you really living if you're not on at least a couple of lists?

Yea, it's full of really awful stuff

Saddly took down the ones I saw.

Or wear kevlar gloves and use a scraper to remove it. If you do get cut by them seek medical attention. Sometimes they put other shit on the blades. This is sadly very common for far right and fascist groups.

They are a white nationalist hate group. More details about them can be found at the [Southern Poverty Law Center website](https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/extremist-files/group/patriot-front). The group split off from a different neo-Nazi organization after the "Unite the Right" rally in Charlottesville in 2017. They were most famously [run out of Philadelphia](https://www.nbcnews.com/think/opinion/philadelphia-bystanders-ran-patriot-front-out-town-it-won-t-ncna1273283) by locals.

How about the 4%ers a 3%er that's also a 1%er now there is a real badass but you might just want to gather up a posse first.

This is where i would insert a copypasta about being a sexual predator purely just as a shitpost

i kept my previous passport in the same safe as a few samples of Trinitite. I was always worried i'd set off some sniffer/geiger counter when going in for government IDs

The crossing poles between Gifford and the music center, there were 2 I saw.

it's super stylized. they can't pretend to not be a fascist organization if they have it unstylized since that was also the flag of the Italian fascists under Mussolini in WWII.

Roll Dukes ‚úäüòî

"This is fine."

Alger chillin with his 500k+ salary putting thousands of young adults in debt yearly

What does Alger have to do with ‚Äúputting people in to debt‚Äù?

‚ÄúCan we get a lowered tuition rate if there is no season?‚Äù JMU: ‚ÄúWell yes but really no‚Äù

I should‚Äôve studied at a community college smhü§°

If anybody needs to do so, Blue Ridge Community College in Weyers Cave, VA (just 15 minutes from Harrisonburg) is fantastic. I returned to college as an older student and had to do some course work there before going to JMU. It‚Äôs cheaper, the faculty is great, and the campus is super nice. I highly recommend it

For me and a bunch of other upperclassmen, CC isn‚Äôt an option. The only classes we have left are the core ones in our major. And taking a semester off isn‚Äôt an option either since for my major, entry to the Spring Classes are contingent on passing the Fall ones :(

The student athletic scholarships are from a separate fund. Most of the athletic fee goes to expenses for transporting the teams, paying athletic staff, and debt service on some facilities. They could get rid of the entire program and keep the scholarships.

In addition, some of us don‚Äôt have the money to have our student loans go into repayment

In which case, you take an entire year off instead of just a semester.

> Once you graduate, drop below half-time enrollment, or leave school, your federal student loan goes into repayment. However, if you have a Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Federal Family Education Loan, you have a six-month grace period before you are required to start making regular payments. You‚Äôll have a nine-month grace period if you‚Äôve got a Perkins Loan. (Got a PLUS loan? You‚Äôll go into repayment as soon as the loan is fully disbursed‚Äîwhich means once it‚Äôs paid out. But if you‚Äôre a graduate and professional student PLUS borrower, you will be placed on an automatic deferment while in school and for six months after graduating, leaving school, or dropping below half-time enrollment.) Per https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment Additionallyany DoE lstudent loans are not accruing interest and no payments are required until December 31, 2020 per Section 2 of https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/ Additionally there are deferment and forbearance options that students taking a gap year would likely qualify for in the worst case.

This pandemic doesn‚Äôt have an end date. It might be over in January 2021 or January 2023. Taking semesters off means I‚Äôm just pushing back my eventual graduation day.

I stand corrected. So about $9.3M of the $52.7M budget (17.6%) is athletic scholarships. That is still a lot of money wasted in this budget...

> Taking semesters off means I‚Äôm just pushing back my eventual graduation day. That would be correct. It's a decision that you would have to make.

Can you share the code for this?

Lmao same homie &#x200B; [https://imgur.com/a/Vxtip4W](https://imgur.com/a/Vxtip4W.png)

nice! the most I've done is make my roof purple

Haven't gotten the kiosk yet to upload designs, also I've been avoiding time traveling :/

That hat is so cute! could you share the code for it, or maybe a screenshot of the pixel design?

Any chance you could take a photo of the design? For those who grew up building Legos, replicating a pattern pixel by pixel scratches that itch big time!

Sho thang! So sadly I don't have the QR Kiosk yet, so I'll give you this little album [https://imgur.com/a/LlPaRLT](https://imgur.com/a/LlPaRLT) Basically what I did was take the Stripped Cap and then palette swapped it, then made the JMU letting you see there, same for the sweater.

Thanks a lot :)

Does someone know the context to this pic?

Looks like an old pic, my guess would be the 2007 game against Coastal Carolina when the mascots fought and Duke Dog got arrested. I was in the student section for that one, it was awesome.

I have a grainy photo of Duke Dog giving the finger from this game, and it‚Äôs one of my most prized possessions.

The fact that OP doesn't know makes me feel ancient

free my boy

Yep. I was there.

Wow I actually know the background to this story. You‚Äôre exactly right. I worked with this Duke dog for a while and we considered [this](https://youtu.be/LQY3xH6FNNY) legendary. Bought him a beer first time I saw the video. Go dukes

That was the second Duke Dog to be kicked out of that game.

Yes! That brings back some memories. When the chicken ran up on Duke Dog whose back was turned, the whole student section went nuts. Later in the game, Duke Dog made a brief reappearance near the Athletic Center and flipped off the visitor section before the cops escorted him away again. I was a recent transfer and that was the day I found my school spirit.

Then another guy who was the mascot came to the game later and just flipped off the CC fan section and was immediately removed too. Good times.

We have officially been ranked!

Lets go! That's actually huge for our program! The guys have been killing it

We want Bama

Congratulations to the team, coaches and staff and the entire student body. Enjoy it today and forget about it tomorrow. Tomorrow is work day, work hard and keep proving those naysayers wrong. You deserve to be in the FBS. Let‚Äôs go Dukes!

Old alum who doesn't really pay attention to sports here! I watched the game last night and enjoyed watching us drub Arkansas State. The announcers would mention our team's bios, and a lot of them already had undergrad degrees, or "played 5 seasons at blah blah blah" state. I always understood the eligibility limits to be 4 years - 5 if a player is a redshirt freshman. Are we exploiting some weird eligibility loophole going from FCS to FBS and whipping other schools' asses because we're fielding 24 year-olds vs 18 and 19 year-olds?

Roll damn Dukes

We are certainly in the spotlight now! So proud of the guys on that team competing the way they have been.

I'll settle for Saban.

nah, transfer rules changed (no longer need to sit a year when you transfer), red-shirt rules changed (can play in 4 games and still redshirt the year, helps if a player is injured or young), and everyone was granted an extra year of eligibility because of COVID in 2020. Plus you're allowed to graduate transfer (go to grad school somewhere else) for a 5th year of eligibility if you want. 5 years + the covid year = 6-year seniors.

Awesome. Thanks for the explanation. Go Dukes!

JMU upsets UVA, 52-49

DON‚ÄôT YOU REGRET NOT COMING TO THE DUUUUKES

I am old enough to remember when we beat Virginia Tech. The next era of an ongoing legacy of domination.

"The zone" prevails. Makes this old Duke smirk with satisfaction.

How was the atmosphere? I hear it was wild!

I was at the game last night. Most incredible atmosphere I‚Äôve witnessed at any sporting event I‚Äôve attended at JMU. The crowd was electric. Especially the students who came out in droves to support the boys. Great way to end a semester

Is it an upset to beat an unranked, 6-4 team?

The Dukes are ^here baby!

Lol that was 11 years ago.

It is when it‚Äôs a school known for excellence in basketball like UVA

As ancient as the sea‚Ä¶

Yeah I was thinking, that happened when I was a student...I'm not *that* old yet!

If it makes you feel any better, my *current* organic chem professor is so old that she started teaching at JMU back in 1974‚Ä¶ when it was still Madison College To put that into prospective, former JMU VP Mark Warner, who is as ancient as a Phosphorus atom, started undergrad at JMU in ‚âà1976(ish)

JMU Men‚Äôs Basketball Sun Belt Conference Champions! The Dukes are going to the tournament!!!

Remember watching them win the CAA championship 11 years ago and excitedly watched them rout Arkansas State tonight, on ESPN no less! Definitely the best JMU men's basketball team I've seen -- they've got the skills and the swagger, and I can't wait to see them go dancing next week.

First time going to the tournament since 2013

DANCING DUKES

Remember watching them win the CAA championship 11 years ago and excitedly watched them rout Arkansas State today! This is definitely the best men's basketball team I've watched and I'm excited they're going to go dancing. Go Dukes!

Congratulations to the Dukes. They played a terrific game yesterday. Glad to see them and Longwood in the NCAA tournament. My Hokies will probably be staying home unless we win the ACC tournament which is a 0.000001 chance. I'm happy as long as UVA doesn't win the ACC tournament and they get destroyed the NCAA tournament. I'll be rooting for the Dukes in the tournament. Sorry Wahoos, NOT!!!

We‚Äôre screwed I‚Äôm a senior here and my snap stories are full of people partying already. No masks, large gatherings, plenty of beer pong. Not to mention that I‚Äôve been here all summer and the chances of seeing anyone in a mask in public is at best 50/50. Students and locals aren‚Äôt taking it seriously, so in the words of our own school ‚Äúpack light this year.‚Äù

There are locals taking it seriously, but you don't see us because we're staying inside. ;-) Seriously, though, the amount of people who are not wearing masks (or wearing them wrong) is definitely concerning. I'm really worried about what will happen when the students come back. It's not that I don't want you all here, but the increase in population is going to really spike our cases. My experience is that it depends on where and when you go places that determine how seriously the staff and clients take COVID. Walmart is a disaster, but if you go to Martin's, Kroger or Target during off peak hours, people are more concerned with social distancing and masks. I know that those places aren't an option for all of you, but just some observations from someone who has been here all summer. I can't speak to how campus is because I haven't been back since all of this started.

JMU *knows* what‚Äôs going to happen and right now they are just trying to push the responsibility onto the students so they can keep as much of their money as possible when things inevitably go to shit

I love JMU but it's literally one of the biggest party schools in VA. It's inevitable :(

It makes me so fucking angry. I'm furious. My blood is boiling. We've been social distancing and staying inside for months \*MONTHS\* of our lives down the fucking drain because JMU wants to be a shining example in Virginia to all the other schools that are already online. Schools such as, I don't know, the HARRISONBURG SCHOOL DISTRICT

Just saw a group having an outdoor get together yesterday on Devon Lane. Definitely more than ten people and no social distancing.

I‚Äôm excited to go back but it feels hopeless as fuck too. Like I can be careful and my 10 closest friends can be careful, but what about their friends? And their friends friends? Shit is gonna spread like wildfire and I feel like there‚Äôs a 15% chance I DONT get it. Unless, that is, I barricade myself in my tiny apartment room and don‚Äôt leave. Piss out the window maybe. And that‚Äôs not gonna happen.

This is terrifying

Focus on the reality: less than 1% of infected individuals are hospitalized and are in serious trouble from the virus and the vast majority of those people are 65 and older. That is not a political statement, that is scientific data. We are going to hear a lot of stories about parties and infection spikes. Groups of students are going to be quarantined. Some of your classmates will die. Those are all given. Just remember this as you grow into adults that run this country: America as a whole operates under the assumption that money is more important than the lives of the population. That is capitalism in a nutshell. Change. It.

From someone in NYC, it's like that here too. Even after everything that happened here. I'd say 50% of people don't cover their nose with their mask and some people are still assholes about wearing them inside stores when it's required by law here in the state. Just today I witnessed a guy in his mid-late thirties, call a young college aged Asian man at the store a "communist motherfucker" for asking him to put a mask on before he went in.

I agree, it‚Äôs just really upsetting to think they would bring in a bunch of people from all over the country, only to infect them and send them home to family where they may live with people in high risk groups. My love for this school has disappeared in the past few months.

Personally I understand the data and I am not fearing for myself or most of my classmates lives as we return. But as someone who‚Äôs father is in a high risk group, once I return to campus I won‚Äôt be planning to visit home until well after the semester. I think it‚Äôs fair to assume a good amount of JMU students are in the same boat, and while we may not be at risk ourselves I have concern for the families and communities of each student that is coming back to campus. Money can still be made by offering an off-campus option, where students can agree to pay the standard tuition but complete their classes from home. Students who believe it‚Äôs in their best interest to do so should be allowed to return to campus. I strongly disagree with JMU‚Äôs ‚Äúall in or nothing‚Äù approach. I think making this a bout against cApiTaLisM is a bit of a stretch...

JMU as an experience and a community is great. JMU as an institution is awful

>where students can agree to pay the standard tuition but complete their classes from home You feel this is okay, but from the posts I've read here recently, most will not be okay with this. I mean shit, people here were ready to grab their pitchforks and torches because they still had to pay the athletics fee. At this point you have to look at it from JMU's perspective in that no decision is going to be acceptable to everyone so they're doing what they think will please the most people while also having the smallest impact to the institution as a whole.

But yet, its the community (people) who are going to parties/not wearing a mask, and ironically its JMU the institution that is asking people to behave in a manner of their own self interest and the community's self interest. Just maybe the JMU institution is great, and the current experience and community is awful.

Obviously it won‚Äôt please everyone, but at least OFFERING the option would be appreciated. Right now if I want to go fully online I have to rig my schedule and change a bunch of classes, which is not an option for me as I only have major required credits left.

I agree 100%. They touted critical thinking so hard when I went there. It's a shame it doesn't matter when their wallet is hurting.

That is so true! This whole Ethical Reasoning goes right out the door with the actions that are being taken place by my alma mater. It throws FORCLEAR, the acronym right out the door.

I still have the card in my wallet! Someone ought to start posting it on social media and asking the administration if they used those eight questions. Otherwise, that whole event during FROG week would have been a sham, and that's surely not the case, right?

Go Dukes!!!

Looked rough in the first quarter, and smallish in size, on Offense. Other than that, a solid win this week.

I enjoy watching Sun Belt play as it reminds me of all the teams we played in the 80's. Ga Southern, App. state and Marshall really reminds me of the old rivalries and great times. Troy gave us a fit in the playoffs for a few seasons, but .. good times overall.

Number 1 school for cases in VA. Roll dukes üòù

If I remember correctly, too, some schools are "cooking" the data by reporting the home zip code as the case. So students who are off-campus living in 22802, but whose "official" home address is somewhere in Jersey, that individual case will appear in the Jersey records rather than Harrisonburg's/JMU's. Not sure if that is happening here, but that's the example I have heard from other colleges.

Off Campus students at VT can get tested on the Health Center.

Positive tests are apparently reported at the billing address, generally the address on the insurance card. A JMU administrator says the cases will eventually be reported at the location of the ill person.

Eagle field last night. No social Distancing, Approximately 1 mask.

Does Harrisonburg‚Äôs 50 person limit not apply here???

I played in this league this summer and they put rules in place but they were pretty much ignored once the season started. For the most part, fans were good about sitting with small groups and such, but most games are played at less confined stadiums where social distancing is possible. No chance of that happening now with students back. JMU should have put an attendance limit on this game. Their facility, their responsibility

Source: https://twitter.com/JMUSportsNews/status/1297857577255079937

are these people completely oblivious as to what's happening in the world i- ...JFC.

The team responded. Just... wow. https://twitter.com/BroadwayBruins/status/1297900725255766016 I don't know how JMU can defend this. EDIT: The team's general manager has called those expressing concern ["fruit loops."](https://twitter.com/BryanDuff3/status/1297914494241386498) **The team has more games scheduled at Eagle Field Wednesday and Saturday. If you're concerned about this, please email Dr. Miller and Jeff Bourne (Director of Athletics) and ask if the university will continue to support the Bruins using JMU property without enforcing masks or social distancing.** millertm@jmu.edu cainml@jmu.edu

I was almost hoping to see zero masks cause then there‚Äôs the chance that this is an old picture but then I saw the one and I‚Äôm just speechless...

Well they've deleted a lot of their tweets.

I hope someone took screen shots of these tweets so that when they eventually backtrack and try to delete them, there are receipts.

The sad thing is the locals will blame the students when there is a spike but the students are the ones wearing the masks. Welcome to Trump territory!

I thought all fall athletics were cancelled?

Post this shit on WHSV‚Äôs Facebook Page, they would love it...

$$$ When JMU sports (and JMU as an institution in general) is a huge chunk of income for the city, you can bet they‚Äôll look the other way

Well this isn‚Äôt an indoor event so, no.

All gatherings on university property are exempt from the city of Harrisonburg's 50 person limit. JMU still has its own restriction of 10 people, however.

Don't forget making fun of a new freshman for trying to follow the safety guidelines.

What makes you think I'm trolling? I am serious about my stance on these matters.

Post it online to WHSV‚Äôs Facebook Page

LMAO wow what a response from a social media manager, absolutely incredible

WTF- that‚Äôs the worst ‚Äúdamage control‚Äù response I‚Äôve ever seen.

I‚Äôm writing an email out to Tim Miller right now, as a junior who is active in greek life I‚Äôm absolutely disgusted by the actions of these individuals. I‚Äôm sacrificing attending reunions with my pledge brothers because I want to do everything in my power to avoid catching & spreading covid so we might, just maybe, be able to stay in person for more than a week. We‚Äôre being told by the university that we are supposed to avoid social gatherings and crowds to keep the student body (and community at large) safe, then an organization not affiliated with the university goes ahead and uses our own facilities to flash a massive middle finger to everything we‚Äôre attempting to accomplish. Baseball is my favorite sport, under normal circumstances I‚Äôd be attending as many games as possible. Now is not the time, and I am disgusted.

Trying to find a mask was like playing where‚Äôs waldo, this is just pathetic

JMU sports are. This is a community team that rents the JMU field.

If Northam wasn‚Äôt willing to make an exception for NASCAR at the Richmond Speedway, no way in HELL was this legal

Admission to these games is free and the team is paying JMU to use the field regardless of if fans are allowed, so money really isn‚Äôt a huge factor. I think the big thing here is the lack of insight by both the league and JMU I‚Äôm not considering the fact that students who haven‚Äôt seen live sports in 6 months will flock to a free admission game within walking distance

Religious and school events too.

Let's say the team complied with the law. It's still 100% hypocritical for the JMU administration to allow this to happen on their property, while at the same time telling students to wear masks, social distance, and not congregate in groups of more than 10.

He looks like someone who would harass 18 year olds on reddit lmaooooooo

Lol the scorched earth approach. That‚Äôs rare.

Jim Sacco, one of their editors, was tweeting about it. Then saw where the Bruins just tweeted [this response](https://twitter.com/BroadwayBruins/status/1298002550667575296?s=20) less than 30 minutes ago. Let's see if they actually follow through...

The city wouldn‚Äôt be getting any of the money from admissions anyway. They also don‚Äôt care if the team pays to use the field (unless the field is city owned, idk), they just care about all the traffic that comes through the city that needs places to stay and eat. Teams, fans, whatever. Bringing in more people from out of town means more money into the local economy

Think about how many people JMU sporting events bring into the city. Those people need places to stay, places to eat, places to get gas, etc. Sporting events stimulate the local economy in a huge way

And then if certain cavalier students see this, they‚Äôll say ‚ÄúShit, well JMU doesn‚Äôt mind this on their own field - guess we can get away with a 15+ person party‚Äù Ugh...wtf, JMU?!

Also looks like someone that would get fucked by Covid. Overweight, shit genes. Good luck pal

He looks like he does worse to younger you mean...

Virginia football in a nutshell

Both would totally destroy us

I mean We‚Äôre not really on the same level but aight.

Lol I think people are missing the joke here

I just hope we don‚Äôt end up like ODU if we join FBS

I was joking about JMU being an extreamly strong team in their conference, but nobody pays attention because they‚Äôre all too distracted by VT and UVA trying to beat each other.

I think we belong more in the American than the ACC

The joke was about how jmu destroys almost everyone their conference, but most college football fans only pay attention to VT and UVA. ... And we kinda beat Virginia Tech, we already played them and won. And that‚Äôs when they had Beamer and we didn‚Äôt have our 2016 championship title yet.

Do you know what happened last time JMU played VT?

I get we‚Äôre in different conferences, the joke was about how jmu destroys almost everyone their conference but nobody notices since most people just care about the VT and UVA rivalry.

The problem with odu. Nobody wants to play there. It‚Äôs the 4th (at best, probably being generous) option in VA for recruits to go to

In 2010? Yeah, we won. Still keeping with the fact that sadly were not in the FBS so we don‚Äôt get to play UVA or VT much if at all.

> and UVa regularly loses to William and Mary... No they don't.

>The problem with odu. Nobody wants to play there. It‚Äôs the 4th (at best, probably being generous) option in VA for recruits to go to Is there a remote possibility of JMU joining FBS within the next ten years? I thought that was what the whole stadium expansion was all about.

We got VT back in the schedule for 2025. Time to gobble that turkey one last time.

We lost to West Virginia by like a touchdown this year too. Not to shabby.

Yeah idk anymore. Back when I came in 2010 the plan I thought was 2015 to have the stadium ton and trying to look for a bid. What I assume is happening is after a couple of title runs they think we are getting more recruits being a FCS ‚Äòpowerhouse‚Äô rather than a FBS doormat.

Conferences like the American want schools with sports that excel in more than football. I think recently JMU has shown that it‚Äôs not just a football school with the success of women‚Äôs lax, softball, women‚Äôs b-ball and both soccer teams. I think it‚Äôs getting more legitimate. It‚Äôs now just a question of where the money for more scholarships will be brought in from.

Should‚Äôve won that game, too. A horrible missed PI call on a would‚Äôve-been Polk TD in the 3rd quarter and a pick on the last drive. One of Dinuccis 3 or 4 interceptions all year. Also coach‚Äôs first game at the helm This team is loaded right now, we play that game again right now. JMU wins by at least 10 and that‚Äôs not an exaggeration.

Ah. It's starting to make sense to me now, and puts into perspective why we're building the new Convo Center (which seats 8,500 -- more than the current \~7,000 seat capacity).

More importantly, at face value, new Convo won't look like exactly what current Convo literally is: a hole in the ground where you play basketball. If anyone's ever been over the mountain to John Paul Jones Arena at UVA, I'm told there's supposed to be a lot of similarities between the two.

The spontaneous protests have returned! They'll complain about anything these days

They just want you to assault and/or batter them and are simply baiting lawsuits. Just ignore them and be on with your day. They‚Äôll move on soon enough.

‚ÄúWomen belong in the kitchen‚Äù Ma‚Äôam‚Ä¶ this is the JMU Quad so why are you here??

It‚Äôs crazy these people don‚Äôt have anything better to do at noon on a Monday.

"gamers are murderers"? is this the most polarizing thing they could think of??

The craziest part is that their list of people going to hell includes "good people." What?? Jesus wants me to be a bad person?

I graduated in 2008 and remember these exact same types of people popping up all the time. It‚Äôs kind of sad

GAMERS ARE MURDERERS

When I was at JMU one of those bastards sued a student because they slipped a wrapped condom in his pocket while he was spewing hate on a megaphone. I heard the student counter sued him for something and have no idea what came of the case, but the best course of action with these scrubs is to ignore them.

Why are they allowed on campus? Obviously trying to intimidate and agitate students.

What, uh, what are they protesting for/against? Their signs seem to have conflicting messages.

What a bunch of clowns on the quad. Need some folks to go up there and have " fuck Trump" written on their ass cheeks and dropped trou.

Mom of 3 dukes here. Don't they have anything better to do? Honestly, wtf

Great counter-protest sign - MOM: ‚ÄúWE HAVE WESTBORO BAPTIST AT HOME‚Äù

Bro I‚Äôm a conservative Christian and this is absolutely too wild üíÄ gamers are murderers? Tomboys? Women belong in the kitchen? Ma‚Äôam why you here then and not in the kitchen

These people, or their spiritual brethren, also attend the Pride Festival every year. Anyone with the training and the time should engage them in a detailed theological discussion. It may make you feel like a bully, like discussing a bearnaise reduction with a fry cook, but they're funny as hell to watch. One guy thought Aquinas was something you took for malaria.

More bogus nonsense. I avoided the area in front of D Hall for this very reason. Too many people every month shouting obscenities to passing students about abortion.

Do yall not realize if you just move on with your day and ignore these people they will not come back to JMU‚Ä¶ They‚Äôre here to bait for a lawsuit, if they know they‚Äôre getting zero attention while on campus they won‚Äôt come back.

I got recommended this sub on my front page, former University of Arkansas student here. I recognize the bearded guy on the right. He came to my campus to do this shit as well with the same kinda signs around 2021 or 2022. The gamers are murderers one is new, though.

I need to know more about these people I‚Äôm so confused why they do it

...does that sign say 'gamers are murderers'?.... Not my only focus, but damn .

What is that woman doing outside holding a sign?

Is that an anti Melania sign?

‚ÄúGamers are murderers‚Äù Ok üëçüèº

They come to UMD too

I counter hold a sign that says ‚ÄúDo not interact: Griftors like them make money off your suffering‚Äù

That's not a protest lol

https://preview.redd.it/nzv4i6f8p6he1.jpeg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fb627d6235686f3ce4483d51b8e8e611a6c92be1 So much has changed. So many things stay the same.

‚ÄúGamers are murderers‚Äù I mean‚Ä¶if it‚Äôs a good game

Gamers are murders ‚Ä¶ but gamers be also jamming to Baba Yetu https://m.youtube.com/watch?v=GtRSLozhTqQ

So we‚Äôve added gamers to the list. Interesting target but go off I guess.

Why doesn‚Äôt campus security make them leave?

Counter protest with ‚Äúthese people are lawsuit baiting‚Äù signs

Bru I wish this happened while I was there so I could argue with them to just piss them off

feds. ignore them

Legalize beating the fuck out of these people

‚ÄúHi, what‚Äôs cooking?‚Äù

Wonder how she‚Äôd take it if I asked her to make me a sandwich

This is their profession. They‚Äôre at work, hoping to close a sale. And by ‚Äúsale‚Äù I mean trying to get assaulted so they can sue the assailant, the school, and the state.

But if a few crazies show up on a Wednesday noon to protest ‚Äúnazis‚Äù in your state capitol that‚Äôs alright correct?

To be fair, they might get me with that one. I would be so confused that I would want to ask them what it means.

Too much among us..

Jesus ain‚Äôt got nothing to do with that nonsense list or those people.

üíÄüíÄ and don‚Äôt forget women belong in the kitchen coming from a woman who has been in the kitchen her whole life üò©üòÇüòÇ

If it‚Äôs anything like the ‚Äúpreachers‚Äù that used to come onto campus it‚Äôs because it is a public campus. Generally police may escort them out eventually but the guy who used to show up all the time was just goading to get shoved or punched to sue a student or the school. These people could be in the same boat. Just stupid is as stupid does.

Public space and they‚Äôre not committing a crime‚Ä¶ still shitbags though

They just sort of spawn randomly. It's mainly just preachy nonsense. Last semester it was usually just one dude and he called me a "Lesbian Creature"

I‚Äôm a Christian as well and it makes no sense. Like hating people for who they are goes against what Jesus wants us to do üò≠

Well traveled folk, I see

JMU offers CR/NC but you can‚Äôt use it for Major, Minor, or Gen Ed Classes... Why?

When my mom asks why our fall and spring breaks got taken away

This is another reason why I am positive that the Alger administration (specifically Heather Coltman) got their credentials as a prize out of a cereal box.

For real, what CAN be taken as CR/NC if major, minor, and gen ed classes can‚Äôt??

Don‚Äôt forget, freshmen are also excluded :)

You can do it for nonsense elective classes

VT and UVA are offering full C/NC and VCU is offering the same thing as us while GMU is currently offering no C/NC options. The difference in policy is very interesting cause usually this school follows UVA to a T. I do see the dilemma that schools face with C/NC making things too easy and possibly harming students in the future, but I also think JMU‚Äôs way of doing it is pointless because it applies to almost nothing.

Literally haven‚Äôt taken a class in all of college that wasn‚Äôt to fulfill a requirement because I‚Äôm spending all my parents‚Äô money and I‚Äôm not here to fuck around. This is bullshit, not based on any viable precedent (because none exists), and is just fucking me over in my last semester. I just want to take one class CR/NC, but no

To encourage students to branch out with their electives without fearing for their GPA.

Don't you want an A?

If you decided to take a random class just for fun? Idk, this is like getting a lifejacket with cement in it

Electives, i.e. classes that don't fulfill any other requirements besides getting up to 120 credit hours.

I mostly agree with the university that overuse of the pass fail option can lead to a disadvantage for students down the road, but this is just completely unfair. Freshman are probably the people who need it most being that their first experience in college ever is online.

Freshmen taking classes on a nongraded basis can *seriously* fuck up their financial aid eligibility and their academic standing. It's a terrible idea and excluded for good reason.

This isn't "JMU's way of doing it." It's absolutely standard policy. UVA's is identical, as I imagine are most other schools'. JMU has opted not to change the policy for this fall, whereas UVA has. That's the only difference.

Or in other words, to encourage students to pay for more classes without losing the ‚Äúcredibility‚Äù required classes

Removing Spring Break but ‚Äúcaring about the mental well-being of students‚Äù. Cautious Optimism... this is only my 2nd semester as a transfer student and I feel like it‚Äôs a circus

This isn't new. This is just the standard policy as it has been for years.

Lmao greats analogy!

Most students need some electives for their degree. You don't pay for anything after 12 credits, so it's only a money-generating policy if students aren't full-time to begin with, or decide to take a class over the summer.

Our little quarantine project :)

I did this early in quarantine on Adobe Illustrator! https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X3aO_XCPTw05w37HHYIDn39Ok_t-wD5m Definitely didn‚Äôt include the more fun references, but I was going for accuracy to the original game. Also includes all the chance, community chest, and property cards.

Is this a copy of the one at target?

You've gotta have a "Pay $300 to parking services" or similar. Get that whole JMU experience in there.

Who‚Äôs winning in GO?

My guy. Is that a Go board? Sick. Do y‚Äôall also know how to play shogi? I really want to find some people to play shogi with

Can you post a clearer photo of it? I can't make out a lot of the writing in the photo, and I would love to see all of the details.

>https://drive.google.com/open?id=1X3aO\_XCPTw05w37HHYIDn39Ok\_t-wD5m love the Conley for Go to Jail lol

That‚Äôs amazing

Can you share more details? or a better pic? This is awesome

My feelings exactly

ill believe it when I see it

I‚Äôve been boycotting parking passes since sophomore year and will continue to do so going into my senior year

when your graduating and spent half of junior and all of senior year online :(

The fact that parking passes weren‚Äôt prorated during online classes just proves that JMU depends on ticketing and passes as a way to make a profit. If you think about it economically, there‚Äôs honestly no reason for for passes to cost $300 and tickets to cost $100. It doesn‚Äôt make reasonable economic sense.

I'm not ready

I'm still wondering how this is going to happen; what about vaccinations? How will they know who is actually vaccinated or not? Lol get ready for shitshow #2 just like last semester's "Come to campus! No, go home! Wait, come back! Okay, stay home"

Me too, I‚Äôm a senior and have never bought one. The buses run just fine ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è

Absolutely not, they just wring students for every single cent that they can get out of them

Anybody give a rundown of what happened at that hypnotist show? Heard stuff went down there that was bad

There‚Äôs a lot to it but I‚Äôll briefly summarize the main stuff: The guy was really creepy and talking about sexual things with students. Throughout the show, he kept having to get an abnormal amount of people out of their ‚Äútrance‚Äù because they were crying, shaking, or other things. The tipping point was when a FROG was sobbing uncontrollably, was unable to walk with assistance (she literally collapsed), and had to be escorted out. After that, the hypnotist was unable to get one of the guys out of his trance. We were all escorted out the back door and there were many police, ambulances, and fire trucks there. I‚Äôm just curious to see if the school will release a statement about it or not!

The Hypnotist went way overboard and tried to hypnotize over 100 people at once. Resulting in multiple people having panic attacks for being left in a trance for too long. I was there, and the whole experience was extremely uncomfortable.

Anyone have videos of this? This is insane...

Is this for real? This is hard to believe but if it is it‚Äôs terrifying

Hey guys, just wanted to weigh in. I was running the sound for the hypnotist event so I spoke with Jon Wayes before and after the show in addition to witnessing the event first hand. I had never met Jon before Saturday night, but by all accounts he is a skilled performer and has been touring for about ten years. I do not believe he is a misogynist. He was attempting to build rapport with the students by resorting to "bro" humor. Certainly, in today's climate it was not a wise choice, but he was not trying to make anybody uncomfortable. He was a nice guy, professional, and was emotionally affected himself by what transpired. By his own admission, this event was a disaster. He simply took on too many students at once. He warned the audience in no uncertain terms that they should not volunteer if they have had past emotional problems, were under the influence, or were pregnant. It seems to me that some students ignored this warning and hence were caught unawares when they were asked to "stay under" for long periods of time. The vibe in the Convo was weird from the word go and Jon spent most of his time handling students that were shaking, crying, or otherwise reacting badly, which caused a cascading effect throughout the crowd. When he realized that the situation was out of control, he stopped the show and spent the next hour tending personally to any students that needed help before succumbing to tears himself. He told me that it was not unusual for participants to have negative reactions and that it happens at least once a show, but that this time it got out of hand. When we spoke after it was all over, he was visibly shaken by what had happened and especially by the treatment he received from the female staff, who felt that he paid too much attention to the young ladies in the audience, and told him so with some venom. Again, from my perspective, from speaking with him personally, I did not feel he was intentionally targeting anyone, but did make bad choices when it came to his humor delivered from the stage. Putting volunteers into uncomfortable and embarrassing situations is part of the humor of the event and I also saw many students posing with "frozen" volunteers to get selfies to have a laugh at later. All of the students that participated were volunteers and many could not handle what transpired. It was really unfortunate that a night of laughs ended with tears and recriminations.

My girlfriend texted me a lot about what happened last night. A lot of her friends went to see it, but she decided not to. She‚Äôs a freshman at JMU, so this is her first year. It sounds really crazy and she just texted me saying that everyone is telling people to delete posts about the hypnotist from social media. Crazy stuff, I‚Äôm glad she didn‚Äôt go.

Was there. Complete and total disaster, hypnotist was kinda a misogynist. Bunch of people got completely screwed up by the trance and broke out sobbing. A frog had to be basically carried out, and the show ended pretty hastily. He had to lead one guy away because he couldn‚Äôt break his trance. Absolutely disastrous.

Wow this is crazy. I remember going to the one at my frog week back in 2004 which was pretty lighthearted and fun. This sounds really disturbing; I hope those of you that were there are OK.

I honestly think younger generations are proving to be mentally soft (not necessarily their fault) and the hypnotist thing should probably be sidelined. Love JMU and I‚Äôm sure that this wasn‚Äôt the hypnotist‚Äôs or JMU‚Äôs intention to cause harm to anyone.

As a close personal friend of the Hypnotist that performed at this event, I have to say, I find this all highly unusual. He has been well trained since he was 19 under the UK Head Hackers and by Anthony Jacquin personally. He is VERY meticulous and conscious of how he preforms at every event. He even teaches other how to hypnotize professionally and to my knowledge has not had any issues, I am one of the trainees and can vouch for his training and ethics. For the guy who is saying that he is apparently untrained and everything else. Trust me he‚Äôs not, and since there are not video clips from what I‚Äôve seen you can‚Äôt just hang a man based on hearsay. There is so much hate in the Hypnotic community already that we shouldn‚Äôt job to such accusations. I‚Äôve yet to personally speak with him about this event. I only learned about it when a client of mine sent me the news article and asked my option. Was not until I did my research that I found out who it was. I was not there for this event but I do know how he runs his shows and what to expect. What the person above commented who did the sound for the show, described what he did and should have done based on his training. He stopped the show and attend to the volunteers that had abreactions. As for others saying that he‚Äôs a misogynistic and far from it. As the guy said before, it seems he went to the ‚Äúbro humor‚Äù way which can be hit or miss with some audiences. Clearly this one was a miss. As the comment above stated, he saw he was physically and emotionally affected by this and I‚Äôm sure has replayed it over and over again in his mind trying to figure out what went wrong. He‚Äôs is a good man and a great performer. Everyone has their off days and bad shows and he‚Äôs no different. It just so happens that this one was publicized and clearly not getting the entire story. It also doesn‚Äôt help that people who know SHIT about hypnosis are commenting on different forums and attacking him thinking they know the first thing about hypnosis other that what movies have told them. I absolutely feel bad for everyone involved and it‚Äôs clear like above, some people did NOT listen to his pre talk speech and warnings. At that point that is all on them as they are adults. Furthermore, I‚Äôm sure if other people found him to be unprofessional or untrained and inept at performing. Then he wouldn‚Äôt be part of two world known entertainment agencies for several years with no issues or be able to be insured for well over a million dollars for each event in case anything does go wrong. I would personally wait until you hear his side of the story as well before making a full opinion, so that the opinion can be fully based on facts. Just my two cents.

Be an informed, enlighted citizen. You could start by reading [https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199203/the-trouble-hypnosis](https://www.psychologytoday.com/us/articles/199203/the-trouble-hypnosis)

As I said, I am only relating my first person impressions and my first hand discussions. I am happy to give way to your expertise of the subject.

What does this say about the culture of 'specialist' at JMU?

What the fuck

If I may chip in for a moment... I am a professional hypnotherapist, so my angle here is as a professional. I was not there. From what I read, this so-called hypnotist was totally untrained, unprepared and even inept. No professionally trained hypnotist would cause such a mess.

Wow that‚Äôs crazy. Scary stuff

Holy crap! Is everyone okay now?

As someone who was there, basically this.

The university has apologized: https://www.whsv.com/content/news/JMU-apologizes-for-hypnotist-show-that-left-some-in-a-trance-558380821.html

Anyone know what the hypnotist's name was? Haven't seen it mentioned anywhere.

What's a FROG?

hold up, this trance stuff really works or they just faking it?

> The Hypnotist went way overboard and tried to hypnotize over 100 people at once. Isn't that how stage hypnosis is supposed to work?

There are a few videos on Snapchat in the Skyline area. It‚Äôs actually really freaky.

Yep, I was there it was very real

Negative reactions (abreactions) do not happen at least once every show. This man you call a professional clearly is not. And touring for 10 years, you say? Sorry, as a hypnotist, I can't buy that. Even if untrained, no experienced stage hypnotist would mess up like this.

Wait - who is telling the students to delete posts? University leadership? The VP of student affairs has publicly commented on this already. If they are trying to cover up the details by asking students to delete comments that is unconscionable!

> It sounds really crazy and she just texted me saying that everyone is telling people to delete posts about the hypnotist from social media. And the correct response to that sort of request is, "Get lost."

what is a frog?

They must have taken a few years off of that, because there wasn't one when I came through in 1999, nor do I remember hearing about it for the other orientation weeks while I was a student.

I was at the one in 2004 as well and liked it so much I snuck back in the following year! üòÇ

There really wasn‚Äôt any fault on either party like you said. When it comes to abreactions, you never know if or when they will happen. And then if there are ppl who have anxiety or panic attack‚Äôs and are triggered by seeing someone else experience what they think is one or is one, then you have ppl to tend to that never volunteered but still need to be brought back to a frame of mind that is good for them. From all the reports from tv, news and on here. That exactly what it sounds like happened on top of kids volunteering even AFTER the Hypnotist gave clear warnings NOT to volunteer if you suffer/experience certain issues. The Hypnotist has apologized and did admit he took on too many students. Which coupled with what sounds like happened explains why it went downhill so fast. But also didn‚Äôt help with rumors and speculation going rampaged with what didn‚Äôt actually happen. All in all the Hypnotist did what he was supposed to do and attend to all affected students individually as needed long after the show ended. So I really don‚Äôt feel/think JMU has a leg to stand on by withholding his payment. No one withheld Michael Jackson‚Äôs money when fans were legit passing out and carried away on stretchers and for physically hurt trying to get to him. Why is that? Because it wasn‚Äôt HIS fault. You can control how other ppl react to events and situations. All you can do is act accordingly in the moment and do everything you can to help. It‚Äôs clear the Hypnotist did just that. Bottom line, he deserves his payment.

I commend you on being honest and giving your first hand account with the event and personally with him. You saw clearly that this did deeply affect him to the point of tears. Which I can tell you from my experience, is rare for him to even happen. That tells me just how deeply it affected him on that level. It‚Äôs just sad to see such hate going around for a man I consider family and a brother. From ppl who were not there and accusing him of horrible things. As I said I‚Äôve not heard from him on the matter and frankly don‚Äôt think I will. Until such time he feels he‚Äôs ready to share and has processed the whole situation himself. Again, I‚Äôm so sorry for everyone involved and the experience they had. It‚Äôs not typical, and it‚Äôs very rare and he did his best within his formal and professional training to react and fix the situation to the best of his abilities. It just sounds like there was too many things going on at once for anyone one person to handle.

Question for you: how much overlap is there between stage hypnosis and hypnotherapy like you do? I imagine that, while they share a name, the two crafts are very different from each other, and require some different skill sets?

My roommate did too and she seemed okay last night. The frogs were telling us to stay with our roommates in Wayland

First-yeaR Orientation Guide

You know in my opinion hypnosis is BS, but I saw first hand the effect it had on people. I think it‚Äôs more so, people being stuck in their head and feeling trapped, which resulted in them having a panic response.

No, that is not how stage hypnosis is supposed to work. You first select the best people from your set of volunteers. That is, you perform tests to see who the best subjects are (easiest to hypnotize deeply AND appear benign, old enough etc.) As a rule of thumb, you end up with a maximum of 5% of the room, and start the show with no more than, say, 15 to 20 volunteers. During the first few bits, some of those are also sent back to their seats. Clearly, this person was inept at stage hypnosis.

Old person question. How do you search for Snapchat videos by an area?

My daughter was there. She was definitely weirded out seeing so many people reacting like that. She herself started feeling dizzy and very tired, so she opened her eyes to keep from being hypnotised. The feeling scared her. That's the first time I knew or even thought hypnosis is real. As for the school, they're not covering anything up. They've asked people to voluntarily refrain from posting videos because there are kids on the videos in distress, some appearing unconscious, draped over chairs (I saw video posted privately by my daughter). Parents of these kids would be upset if they saw those videos before they knew what happened and that their kid was OK. And even then, they would not want their kids exposed like that. I would certainly want people to not share it if my daughter was in a video like that. EDIT: On further thought, I don't know that anyone from the school asked people to remove videos from posts. I saw a parent ask that. She was an administrator of an unofficial Facebook group for parents (there is a separate official group run by the school). She asked people to voluntarily not share videos privately for the reasons I stated above, and said she would delete any posted to the private group).

I can't seem to find any sort of statement, got a link?

I don‚Äôt know, it‚Äôs just what my girlfriend told me. I don‚Äôt go to JMU.

**F**irst yea**R** **O**rientation **G**uide. Basically older students (usually sophomores/juniors I think) who lead groups of freshmen during 1787 Orientation week.

You don‚Äôt have to be so rude to people. You have your opinions that hypnosis is fake and no amount of research and proof is going to change your mind. However, it doesn‚Äôt give you any right to go ham on someone who went through an experience you don‚Äôt understand at all. I‚Äôm not here to try and convince you that hypnosis is real or not, I‚Äôm just telling you to let the fuck up on your bashing of the kids and others that have had experiences with it, especially the negative ones.

Almost no one starting college this year is a millenial. >Pew Research Center decided a year ago to use 1996 as the last birth year for Millennials for our future work. Anyone born between 1981 and 1996 (ages 23 to 38 in 2019) is considered a Millennial, and anyone born from 1997 onward is part of a new generation. https://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2019/01/17/where-millennials-end-and-generation-z-begins/

They are absolutely different. However, even a stage hypnotist needs to be aware of the basic techniques for hypnotee safety, effective suggestion delivery, dealing with abreactions (which should be rare), being aware of trance depth, not going too deep and taking a person out of Esdaile state (very deep hypnosis), etc. The fact that this person seemingly had none of these skills shows that he has not been properly trained.

Hypnotherapy is about guiding people towards change in order for them to conquer difficulties such as quitting smoking and changing eating habits, releasing chronic pain, etc. Each of these require some level of understanding of the problem the client needs to resolve. Hypnotherapists need to be able to work with almost anyone, whilst stage hypnotists have the luxury of selecting only those volunteers who are easy to hypnotize quickly and deeply.

Yeah, I've heard that it's not going to work on you if you don't want it to. However, if you want to and your impressionable enough, you can get into that state.

We lost a future Duke, y'all [https://www.change.org/p/morristown-police-department-justice-for-amani-kildea](https://www.change.org/p/morristown-police-department-justice-for-amani-kildea)

Absolutely horrible.

Amani was a fellow classmate from my high school in Long Valley, he was a very kind person and while this came out of nowhere I saw the statement his parents made on Facebook the day he was found (which has since been taken down). It was ruled a suicide, there was no evidence to it being a lynching however Long Valley is a predominantly white town, but never has it been a hateful one. He was a truly good person and it completely shocked me hearing this. If it was a lynching I hope that the people who did this are brought to justice.

terribly sad. and he was a fellow ethiopian as well, im heartbroken.

Rest in Power, Amani. Justice for all victims of violence.

THIS. This is why BLM supporters protest. No, we don‚Äôt want you to take episodes of Golden Girls down, no, we didn‚Äôt ask for ‚Äúmaster bedroom‚Äù to be changed. We just want justice and for police to stop killing UNARMED BLACK MEN

Fuck the monsters who did this and the cops that didn't investigate.

The description given for the petition is blatantly wrong. It‚Äôs currently under investigation. https://www.pix11.com/news/local-news/new-jersey/investigation-into-amani-kildeas-death-remains-open-nj-prosecutors-say

Rest in Power young king. üòïüòû

Yeah, he ‚Äúkilled himself‚Äù the same way that Jeff Epstein ‚Äúkilled himself‚Äù (he didn‚Äôt)

hmm don't wanna be racist but what does this have to do with race..?

The poor guy killed himself. This isn‚Äôt about Vietnam either.

It‚Äôs being investigated, look at the link I posted.

Do you want cops or not?

Doesn‚Äôt invalidate the fact that a 20 year old college student was lynched. Your post history says everything about you and the context of this comment.

‚ÄúI won‚Äôt want to be racist but let me completely ignore systematic racism while exerting white privilege‚Äù

He was, more than likely, lynched. It's usually reserved for black folk, and it's been happening a lot more since the protests started.

Along with neurodivergent/disabled black people as well.

Ah my bad, saw the change petition which stated it wasn't investigated

I was just pointing out misinformation, don‚Äôt get so defensive.

It doesn't validate that theory either. He was part of a crew of online stalkers who tried to catch pedophiles. When they can't find enough material they resort to [sexually assaulting people at a grocery store](https://youtu.be/kE6wL4o7dlQ) for a "prank". That's reason enough in my book to kill yourself.

Well, the petition is from a day ago, and the article is from today. It also mentions that some officials did state that earlier.

You‚Äôve called people ret*rded in the defense of a long dead loser from the Civil War on this sub. [I was one of them, so I remembered after you deleted them to save your karma. ](https://www.removeddit.com/r/jmu/comments/he03hb/jmu_will_formally_rename_ashby_jackson_and_maury/fvpn0gu/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=ios_app&utm_name=iossmf) Calling someone else defensive is bold, coming from you.

Ah look everyone ^ a pedophile. Someone that thinks vigilantes against sexual predators and pedophiles Should kill themselves... weird flex

What are you even talking about? Use them as pawns? I'm sad that a future Duke was killed and you think this is about, what, political gain? You're even acknowledging he could have been killed in what you said. We live in a time with active hate groups and extreme racial tensions, is it that much of a conspiracy to believe, with multiple black people found hanging from trees within weeks of the protests, it could have been a lynching? So, we rule it as a suicide and leave it at that, even though he could have been killed. Is that not worth investigating? That someone might have gotten killed? Either way, it breaks my fucking heart, and I'm sad that it's political to want a serious investigation. I hope you have a good day.

This was gold

I love this song

You guys are calling it a lynching with literally zero evidence whatsoever. I‚Äôm just cautioning slightly and I get called racist. Lmao üôÑ

Every tyrant has a pretext for[ making women drink breast milk against their will.](https://youtu.be/kE6wL4o7dlQ)

dude for the most part, black people wont hang themselves from trees know the history behind it lmao. to automatically think its a suicide is just blatantly ignorant

I feel this on a different level

Literally got sent YouTube videos to learn calculus. Makes you think what we're paying for

hopefully ppl will realize that most college classes are bullshit

My guy, you‚Äôd be going on YouTube regardless. I sure as hell did back in 2015. Khan is the shit!

If you need extra help, reach out to your prof. I took an online physics class through the community college and my prof responded to individual questions with detailed videos. Not saying that is what will happen here, but remember to (respectfully) access your instructors like the resources that they are. Not saying this ideal, and certainly frustrating to have mode of instruction changed halfway through the semester, but this is an unprecedented world event.

Lol thank you for a realistic take üòÇ. I guess everyone just wants a free pass for the semester without having to do anything.

More like ‚Äústarting to question universities ‚Äú For a lot of people this is their first interaction with universities being a gateway of accreditation, when all the work and access to information is done by the students at home.

Love Khan! "Crash Course" does a great job with STEM topics as well. A benefit to online instruction is that you can re-watch videos/concepts you don't quite understand as many times as you need.

college classes can be beneficial but obviously we can learn all those material on fucking youtube so why tf am i paying thousands for this lmao

Agreed. I mean, a professor is just reciting the $200 textbook anyway, might as well watch a video vs reading the textbook. Professor is (should) there to help with questions really.

Nobody is forcing you..

Accreditation. Universities hoard access to accreditation and information through this subscription to journals norm. We really don‚Äôt need universities anymore and I think they can hold a lot of us back. They give us an avenue to skate by and not learn this stuff or its applications. The universities need to take a big hit

ye, current freshmen are younger than iTunes

JMU can fuck right off with their "Giving Week" emails As an alumnus and Hburg resident, it seriously pisses me off to receive emails asking me to donate money when they are keeping the university open and endangering the lives of students and the wider Harrisonburg community. It is shameful that our alma mater is treating their students, faculty, staff, and welcoming Harrisonburg community with such negligence and disrespect. It is alarming to see the dashboard, knowing that the numbers are likely much higher in reality. The only thing I want to "give" JMU is a kick in the ass. /rant

What is worse is that this ‚ÄúGiving week‚Äù is normally held around March / April time. This just further makes me feel like once refund period has come and gone things are going to go south...

I‚Äôm calling for Alger AND the board of visitors to resign over this. They have shown they are in no way capable of ensuring student safety. This is coming from an alum who enjoyed my time at the school but Alger was always a terrible President.

‚ÄúJMU needs your support this Giving-‚Äú *unsubscribes*

Emails I never signed up to receive too, on my personal email I don't recall giving to the school specifically. Being an alumni to them just means $ farm.

Yup, pissed of alumnus here, too. Will never give them a red cent after this fiasco. 500 cases and my family lives here, most of them within the age-range that makes them most vulnerable.

You left off the part about Alger getting free housing, transportation, and catering on top of a over half a million dollar salary.

It seems like nothing because all he does is tell other people what to do, but his decisions have extremely far-reaching consequences. If Alger did nothing, JMU wouldn't be in the mess it is right now. Their entire response, as uncoordinated and lackluster as it appears, was still planned out by him and several other people. This is true of all executives no matter the industry. They spend all their time in meetings and making hundreds, if not thousands of decisions every week. It becomes immediately obvious how important your CEO, COO, manager, etc. is once you're working full time and you realize how much of the culture and structure of the organization comes from them.

Pretty sure most schools put off giving week given the state of the world this past March/April. Surely things couldn‚Äôt get worse...

John Mulaney nails this topic : https://youtu.be/aiqKK4ysI7g

Correct. Almost every school cancelled theirs because they read the room. JMU moved theirs to back to school to focus on scholarship fundraising since its become a need hence the "Pay it Forward" and "Madison for Keeps" pushes.

Yeah, I agree. I see it‚Äôs a business transaction. I paid to get my four years of schooling and now I‚Äôm done. I might like an amusement park but I‚Äôm not going to to just keep sending the place money every year.

I transferred in and never paid room and board, so it was way less than that, and I have no desire. Now, I may consider one day giving to where I got my doctorate from because they actually have some pretty cool programs for the students in that program.

I was waiting for someone to bring this up

You're doing the right thing though. It hurts not to have those "college experiences" but there will be other opportunities when we're not in the midst of a pandemic. Thank you from an Alum (13/14) turned Harrisonburg local.

Dang I've never felt so sad for a cat before.

In addition to the comments about being responsible, just keep in mind that those neighbors could very well end up delaying their graduation if the university finds out and they get suspended. If you hold a party and there are 50+ people there, it almost a guaranteed suspension through the end of the academic year if it ends up at OSARP:

There goes any alumni funding from me.

*cautious optimism intensifies*

Stay Safe - Don't go back TL;DR I love the students, professors, support staff of JMU and want you all to be safe and healthy. Fuck the administration for putting you in danger. Stay home, stay safe, don't attend this semester. I am an alum and during my time I have come to love the students, staff, and professors (honestly most of my professors were pretty solid) of JMU and the Harrisonburg +valley community. You all have helped me become a better person, citizen, and professional. I have learned about topics I never dreamed of when I was growing up and learned a lot about myself. But I have come to absolutely despise JMU's administration. From continuously rising academic costs to attend, nickle-and-dime-ing students, difficulty navigating admins with regards to my chronic illness, consistent disregard for diversity, inability to handle sexual harassment cases and for prioritizing unsustainable construction and expansion over the quality and cost of your education, there is no love for JMU's administration from me. They now have added another item why I will never donate or promote JMU as an institution and that is the bullshit way that they are handling the pandemic for the Fall semester. JMU moved to online-learning when there were 4,000 cases, but now want to open up when there are over 4.7 million total cases in the US and over 150,000 deaths. More people have died in 6 months of this virus than US combat deaths in WW1 (US involvement lasted roughly a year and a half). Schools were shut down when the attacks on 9/11 occurred, but to me it is absurd that schools would open in the middle of a pandemic that to-date has taken almost 50 TIMES MORE US LIVES THAN THE 9/11 TERRORIST ATTACKS. JMU's opening plan is not realistic, and they don't care about your health. Seriously, my office has more strict requirements than JMU's 8 day quarantine plan. My office requires 14 minimum days if you are exposed, a doctor's note, and we have been also WFH since March. How is JMU going to even enforce that? An honor-pledge? The Honor-pledge didn't stop cheating at JMU last I checked. JMU wants you to come back because that is how THEY MAKE MONEY. They are willing to trade your health/lives for cash. Believe it or not that despite the amount they charge you, JMU is strapped for cash. They have invested so much money in land/infrastructure that they need you to physically be there in order to make money from the services of the land/infrastructure (think dorms, parking, meal plans, UREC, etc.) This is the down-side of modern american higher-education. The flashy and luxurious campuses/dorms/amenities are how they attract students to come to their school and they charge you for it. It's an amenities arms-race honestly. When I did my college tours in 2013, literally every school I visited had "inner-tube water-polo" as a selling point. What about the academics? The reason most European universities are cheap because they are literally 5 big fucking concrete buildings that you go do hw in, take tests, study, do labs and get the fuck out from. You don't have to walk 15 minutes to get one section from campus to the other. My family from Europe has commented that my school is its own city! That's not normal anywhere else on the planet. The land and buildings aren't cheap. The school gets grants to build/buy this but guess who gets to pay the maintenance costs + taxes! You do! Going virtual would upend the years of the "amenities" arms-race I was talking about and make it moot. it would completely shatter the illusion you need all that land/facility/fancy bullshit that they tack on to justify increasing your tuition each year. It is not your responsibility to bear the brunt of JMU's poor financial decision-making! What can you do while not at JMU? Nothing during this pandemic is ideal, but the best we can do is mitigate a semester or two off. Take online courses/gen-eds from community colleges. It is not too late to enroll. To underclassmen/underclasswomen, you can knock out your geneds cheaper and usually easier, but make sure you check in with your registrars office first. Even if you miss the regular deadlines, Community colleges also organize some courses by first 6 weeks and last 6 weeks, you might be able to snag some of those courses; do be warned they may be accelerated. Your quality of education is already going to be crippled this year, its not worth paying all this money to start your academic career like this. To upperclassman/upperclasswomen - you can take a semester or two off. This is absolutely a valid option and don't let people bully you into not considering it! The "you will be behind argument" is bullshit. Behind who exactly? The millions of other people who are trying to survive this pandemic? It took me 5.5 years to graduate, I took extended time away from school for health reasons and I came back to finish what I started. If you have a direction in mind I am certain that you will complete your education even if you take a semester or two off. Again check with your registrar. I took a semester off without my loan's interest kicking in or having to re-enroll at JMU. Non-profit organizations are always looking for volunteers. Meetup dot com (sorry dont know the subreddits rule for links) is a great place to find orgs that you can network, volunteer, and practice your skillset or find one if you are willing to explore. Highly recommend, this is also how I found my current job. The risks of returning Your health, obviously, but it is a bit more nuanced than that. You could be lucky and and never catch it. You could be extremely unlucky, catch it, and die. Are those the dice you want to roll? Lets also explore the in-between options. You could be asymptomatic and pass it to no one. You could be asymptomatic and start a whole another cluster by passing it on to other people. You could get sick and recover quickly, or you could be sick and be on a ventilator for 51 days and lord-knows what other complications you could develop down the line (read the NY Times article "51 days on a ventilator"). I don't know about you but when I went to school the most I had to worry about was catching the common cold. The quality of your education is going to suffer. Stressed and sick professors don't make for good lecturers. Chaos is not a good learning environment. You are spending exorbitant amounts of money (and loans that accrue interest!) to get less in return. My recommendation. The only way I can in good conscious recommend attending JMU this year is if everything is online and virtual. JMU has not announced that it is starting online, while UVA has. This will be the only time I endorse UVA over JMU and urge you to consider a transfer (or to any accredited school that is doing online-only during the pandemic!) or start at a Community College. Absolutely no shame in that. What JMU is doing is appalling and the implication of money > your safety is a terrible precedent to set. Closing I write this because I care. I care about the health of the students, faculty, support staff. I care about the quality of your education. You made me the person I am today and I am pissed that my own (the students,support staff, faculty) are being put in harms way unnecessarily. I care that you are getting unnecessarily fucked by the powers to be just because they said so. I learned from JMU to question authority, even if that authority is JMU. I wrote this because I cannot do nothing in the face of wrong; it would weigh on my conscious if I didn't voice my thoughts/concerns and maybe help someone stay safe. Dukes step-up. Stay home, stay safe.

All these people taking gap semester making me not look so bad for graduating late :)

Last semester was taken from the students. they shouldn't let this semester be inevitably taken from them as well. Take the the semester off and fully enjoy this school when it's safer.

None of this is wrong. During a normal year, dorms are still a Petri dish. I had the worst flu of my life when I was a freshman in Hillside and with the way things are going now, there is NO foreseeable way that students on campus could be safe. Not to mention that people WILL party, WILL ignore mask rules, and you‚Äôll be forced to live in the same confined space as them. I think the question for an upperclassmen about what to do is much more difficult, but if you‚Äôre an incoming freshman, stay home and take online community college classes. Do not pay 4X to go to a JMU summer camp for two weeks and get sent home to do the same exact thing. You will not get the freshman experience the rest of us got. No Halloween, no football, no going out, none of it. I‚Äôm sure staying at home w your folks when you thought you were finally leaving sucks, but trust me, your bank account five years from now will thank you.

As a fellow alum, amen. I know there are people who are all I BLEED PURPLE, but from a distance, JMU has been a near-complete shitshow from an admin level for about 15 years now. Thank goodness the faculty and staff are there to blunt the edge. I was amused by the recent alum surveys that were sent out and realized that I barely had anything positive to say about the direction of the place. For gened students...don't forget many community colleges are fully online (or mostly).

I‚Äôm concerned about their rules (or lack of rules) for student teachers. I‚Äôm going into the local schools full-time this semester, and the one I‚Äôm assigned is 4/5 days per week in-person. No masks required, no temp checks etc for the students at the school. One evening per week all of us student teachers from the surrounding school districts come back onto campus for our required class together, bringing anything from the schools back with us and having interactions with each other. The next morning, we all disperse back out again. Seems like a recipe for something going wrong

what do you recommend for someone like me who‚Äôs a rising junior and doesn‚Äôt have any gen-eds left? and doesn‚Äôt wanna graduate late? i still have two minors to get through. i suppose i could try to change my schedule to only online classes.

I wouldn't go back and take a semester or two off, but I only have 9 credits left. Short of ACTUALLY bending me over a fence, I'm finishing this shit then never going back.

It‚Äôs literally going to a horrid fail. People aren‚Äôt going to wear masks, corners are going to be cut with quarantining and cleaning...students return to classes the same week thousands of students are returning from various different places(some having the virus and not knowing or coming in contact with those who are sick). It doesn‚Äôt make any sense, how is money more valuable than thousands of lives? Baffled to be an alum from this school that praises its educational stats but can‚Äôt even be smart enough to stay online

JMU administration is most likely deciding to push this semester entirely online within the next week.

Thank you for writing this! I am recent double alum as well!

I‚Äôm a rising junior and transferred from a community college. I‚Äôm attending in the fall for in person classes. I don‚Äôt think jmu is bad for it. They aren‚Äôt forcing anyone to do anything. It‚Äôs really just student choice whether to attend or not. I choose to attend. I appreciate the concern; felt like it came with good intentions. I‚Äôve done my research and I‚Äôm happy with my decision.

You have decades of time to work later in life, I'm sure 10 years from now you will not look back and say "man I wish I didn't wait that extra 6 months to graduate back in 2020"

Hell yeah man, I took a gap semester and was a thousand times better for it. Whatcha switch majors to?

Yikes. Great points and glad you are thinking so responsibly about this. Maybe bring up these concerns with your professor? Good luck out there teaching

Through a good amount of awkwardness I was able to make a full load schedule of only online classes. All it took was doing some things in weird order, emailing some professors, and taking some non-standard requirements.

Good questions, I am glad you brought them up. Like I said in my post, these are not ideal times, we can only mitigate damage for the most part. If you can take your classes online - highly recommend it. If you have to fall under full-time status, do it, you have 6 months to return to full-time status before your loan payments kick in. Better to be safe than sick. You might have to take may-mester classes to "catch up" (catch up to what though, life is a marathon not a sprint). Whether you like it or not - you may be graduating late. This is a no-win scenario. The quality of your education is going to be affected. If you get sick or come in contact with someone who is sick, you are going to quarantine for 2 weeks and be doing classwork online anyway. I can imagine that you will be required to do multiple quarantines if multiple outbreaks occur on campus. If your professor is sick, then what? You're going to be missing instruction. If you are extremely unlucky, you'll be in the hospital where graduating on-time will be the last thing on your mind. Either way, your quality of education this semester is not going to be as good as pre-pandemic. For that reason alone it is worth postponing your plans. Let me tell you a bit about my story and why I am glad I didn't stick to my path and graduate on time. I started out music and realized a year in that I hated it. Switched majors and started from scratch. Started International Relations and hated that too. Then I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and was too ill to go to school. During my time off i recovered and found my path (IT/software dev - took a course on a whim at a community college). I am glad I took time off because 1) i could explore my career options freely 2) while I was sick I couldn't learn - I wasn't getting anything out of my education, much like how the quality of your instruction will suffer through the sheer chaos of the times we live in and how unprepared JMU was in response. They had all summer to set up infrastructure and they pissed the opportunity away. 3) I realized graduating on-time and adhering to other people's expectations and time-frames is bullshit and trying to keep up expectations/appearances was exhausting. When I was accepted into the CoB and did COB 300 I met people who were 24, 28, and 32 years old. Some were military, some dropped out earlier and decided they wanted to finish, some just took longer. Mind you Cob300 is just a bit after the halfway point in the school business majors. These people were graduating at 26, 30, 34 years old. All three of those people are doing EXCELLENT in their careers and are extremely mature professionals. It took me 5.5 years to complete and I have no regrets for it. If i stayed the course and graduated on time, I would have finished with a major I hated and I would have despised my entire time here because I was sick and not getting anything out of it. There is no shame in graduating late, pushing to graduate on time for the sake of it is not worth your well-being and health and you won't get as much out of it education-wise. You have your entire life to graduate and do good in this world. How long it took doesn't matter, especially during these strange times. There is no gradution-on-time-police. No one cares how long it took you. Do keep busy - or take the semester off. Believe me with a full time job it is harder to take vacay than I realized. Take advantage of the part-time semester or entire semester off. Finding a volunteer organization you can safely contribute is one route. I volunteered software dev at local non-profits and went to "code and coffees" I found at [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) (they have all since become virtual). I ended up meeting someone who hired me at these events. If you have an internship, reach out to the internship host org and let them know you can continue working with the organization if they'd have you. If you free-lance or have a side-gig, I highly recommend engaging in that. I am in no ways suggesting being idle, although that could also be a possibility. if you want to rest, take advantage of it now.

God-speed and stay safe. Just know there ain't no rush. What COB major are you studying?

I hope so. Then I can make an edit and say "full-send online classes.... just stay home" lol

Double alum! What did you study?

Sure, more power to you, but buyer beware. The lack of transparency, enforceable rules/plan, and slow communication would make me wary. As for concern, you'll probably witness a disappointing lack of it from your peers. We couldn't keep it classy during either of our game days. Not a problem unique to JMU unfortunately.

As a guy who did take extra time to graduate - 30 years ago - I can guarantee you'll never ever think about it. It's not a race, there's not a time limit. Protect your health, conserve your money, go to college when it makes sense to.

Colleges use 5 years as the graduation "on time" metric.

Went to sociology from business. Less money probably but I can hopefully do something that matters to someone.

I just stayed focused on the chance to win a gift card.

i‚Äôll have to look into it. i‚Äôm glad it worked out for you! too bad it‚Äôs not an easy task though. there are plenty of compromised students that need this option

Business management with a minor in supply chain management! They've moved one online, so I only have two in-person classes left. I won't be in campus much!

I earned my B.M. In Music with a concentration in Music Industry and Africana Studies minor and most recently, an M.Ed. in Counseling Psychology with a concentration in College Student Personnel Administration.

The guidelines that are in place I would hope my peers would follow them or else we all have to pack up and go home. Not only that but figure out finances and if there will be reimbursements. But only time will tell. Fingers crossed though

Oh i‚Äôm not worried, my major change that set me back is well worth the money and time. Plus now i‚Äôm actually interested in school.

The DC area has a lot of business who use researchers or people with research skills. As long as you develop solid analytical and quantitative skills, I think you'll do just fine. I was surprised at how much stats my sociology friends had to use.

I am disappointed this is not in the grad cap contest.

word of advice: don‚Äôt buy parking passes/meal plans/books/etc until you actually know campus is gonna be open and stay open cause JMU does not give a fuck about you they just want your money and will not refund you if and when shit hits the fan

Parking services has been pushing people to buy their passes before the semester even starts. They'll give a refund if we move online. 17 bucks. If we're lucky.

I was thinking about getting the meal plan done in a week or two, but you're right, who knows how much I would be refunded... Good advice.

If I‚Äôm an upperclassman living on campus (a mistake already, I know), and need to bring my car with me, what‚Äôs the safest bet for parking my car until I‚Äôm sure we‚Äôre staying?

no meal plan refund if we get sent back?

It will be like this for basically every university; once they have your money they will be VERY reluctant to give it back. It will become a credit in your student account. If you graduate with a credit? Don't hold your breath until you get your money back...

Thank you for this post! I keep receiving parking pass deadline reminders. They indeed are pushing it. I wouldn't recommend getting any of these until we know for sure what JMU is actually planning on doing this Fall. I was thinking of getting a meal plan too but I'll use cash to eat on campus for now. Great advice! Thanks :))

Parking services can stick all the cacti in the world up their bumb. The worst.

A couple semesters back I switched to just using Flex for everything. You lose a bit of money if you eat at D or E halls a lot, but I see it as worth it for the security of it never expiring.

You should probably find a friend who has a house and park there. Otherwise you‚Äôre gonna have to park on campus and pay for the pass.

Use hunters road. Street park there it‚Äôs next to that drive thru Starbucks and gas station.

Someone already said it, but I‚Äôll say it too for emphasis: hunter‚Äôs road right by the Starbucks (the one that‚Äôs right next to hunter‚Äôs ridge apartments) is free 24/7 parking and is a quick walk from campus.

The Harrison has guest spots you can park in (I graduated in 2018 so they could have changed the rules but AFAIK that was the case at the time). I can probably mark out a map for you if you want it

I live in the Harrison and there‚Äôs visitors parking at the back of the complex

A few years ago I was given a teacher paper parking pass to put in my window while I worked on campus over the summer. Well the person wrote the pass for May of 2014 through late August of 2015, instead of August of 2014. I had a parking pass decal on my car from the previous year. So there were a few times I saw parking services looking at that, seeing the temporary pass, and leaving in defeat. I got a couple of tickets, which i successfully protested and was able to keep the pass as I had proof of being a paid employee of the university (as in, paid by JMU, not Aramark or something) while I was a student. It brought me so much joy.

Yeah my tentative plan is to go with Dining Dollars and buy groceries to cover the rest.

Lmao why did he bring a boat to college

Solid plan!

how do you put money into flex? i just luckily got out of my dorm and changed to being a commuter & i‚Äôm considering just eating packed food mostly and eating lunch at campus every day

I would recommend you do Dining dollars gold. With DDG, you get 5% off on campus & pay no tax. You don‚Äôt get that with flex, I‚Äôm pretty sure. You can call card services to set it up & upload money over the phone or online. This is what I did for 3+ years living off campus. I mostly packed meals but would load $100-200 a semester for when I was super busy and didn‚Äôt have time to cook or pack.

> You don‚Äôt get that with flex, I‚Äôm pretty sure Yep - Flex is exactly like cash, but via your JAC card.

can you use student loan money to load onto that account? i would be using it to pay for a meal plan anyways so that would make sense to me

As long as your loans are getting refunded to you, you can really use them for whatever you‚Äôd like. So yes, you can load that money onto the DDG account

When I'm going to the library but I see the clubs and frats posted up all over Warner Commons

Relatable. Except I cut through by the honors college

Question: who is the Warner in Warner Commons? Back when I was a student, it was just "The Commons".

Biking through helps.

Fake a phone call

me too screw that caution tape

Dr. Mark Warner - Senior Vice President of Student Affairs. He retired at the end of the 2017-2018 school year and was absolutely the best person on JMU's campus.

I agree but not when it‚Äôs cold üò¨

aww i had no idea they renamed it for him!! i remember being an RA and he dropped in during move-in day and complimented me on my spirited purple and gold nail polish üòÇ what a kind dude

Ah, yes, I remember him. Good guy. I hope he enjoys his retirement.

Cursed cookout

That sunset was crazy yesterday!!

Maybe it's nature's way of kicking off autumn...

If I hadn't seen it myself, I would assume that this was some kind of filter. It was eerie!

Last night, Ben DiNucci became the first-ever JMU QB to play in an NFL game!

Great to see @B_DiNucci6 out there tonight! \#NFLDukes *** posted by [@JMUFootball](https://twitter.com/JMUFootball) Photos in tweet | [Photo 1](http://pbs.twimg.com/media/EkvfrotWkAMLcfC.jpg) ^[(Github)](https://github.com/username) ^| ^[(What's new)](https://github.com/username)

Monitor someone put on the quad

I know the person who did it and and that person is an amazing human

I wouldn't touch that sharpie without gloves...

Based on the website, it sounds like they will, but I imagine that it won't be the same as a "normal" commencement. I imagine that turnout will probably be much lower because it's going to be a hard ask to get everyone to come back to dwell on the past. People will have mentally moved on, and I'm sure that many won't be able to make it or willing to go. In other words, I think that for many, the moment will have passed, and there will be no replacing it.

Seems likely that it was destined for the dump anyways. And it‚Äôs a nice piece of art if that something you‚Äôre into.

Idk what the first comment says but you‚Äôre correct, it was a broken monitor. Definitely put to better use than the dump.

[According to Removeddit](https://www.removeddit.com/r/jmu/comments/flx2gc/monitor_someone_put_on_the_quad/), /u/Helpful-Astronomer said, "What a waste of a monitor." I can understand why they deleted their comment.

happy assessment day

My team produced this video! Back when I worked in the libraries. It was a fun project. It was the Assessment people who wrote the script, lol

Will someone explain this to me? I must be a dullard.

I need more assessment memes

Someone meme the clip of Alger in the video please

That's so awesome. Wish I had done SMAD

It made me crack an actual smile before doing the assessment and I was not in a great mood at the time.

Probably a joke on the "no electronics" policy. I don't remember because my assessment day was last year.

Aw, that's awesome to hear! That was the plan, so I'm glad to hear it worked!

they also played this video before everyone‚Äôs assessment today lol

OHHH YEAH that's right I remember that

Make good decisions tonight Dukes :)

JMU Eliminates DEI https://www.breezejmu.org/news/jmu-eliminates-dei/article_fcdb280c-a09f-4c64-a33f-cf102c5dfe52.html

This shouldn't surprise anyone. UVA, Tech and VCU have all already done it. It is very much an "if you want to keep getting funding, you don't have a choice" scenario. Thankfully they're putting the money into scholarships and CMSS, so probably a lot of the people who benefit from DEI programs will still get something out of it.

JMU has to comply or risk losing federal funding, which would be disastrous. So don‚Äôt blame JMU. Blame Trump and anyone that voted for him.

It‚Äôs the smart play. Feign compliance to keep doing the right thing under the radar. Hope students on campus see the thinking and reality behind it.

If you look at the Board of Visitors, and who selected all of them, you‚Äôll see why they are in line with our current federal administration‚Ä¶

Based on the article, it looks like they tried to minimize the damage and moved a lot of it under different departments. Hopefully, this is true. Even if it is, it would‚Äôve been really cool to see JMU stand up to this administration. Even if it was unlikely

I do not understand why they would, it just generates bad press and a bad reaction from their students

That‚Äôs really disappointing but can‚Äôt say I‚Äôm surprised at this point in the shit show.

They eliminated the DEI office. In other words, they reduced the administrative bureaucracy. It does not mean that they have abandoned DEI.

I‚Äôm glad to see it, you should be accepted based on academics not skin color or background

All business are fair-weather friends. They go with what will give them the best outcomes financially at any given time, regardless of morals. Yes, universities are businesses at the end of the day.

Outside of Princeton, they all rolled over to facism. Cowards.

Good! Stay woke go more broke!

Great news! That racist program should be completely abolished on a federal level.

Great news!

That‚Äôs how I think they‚Äôre swinging this. Moving all the money into ‚Äútotally not DEI related scholarships‚Äù and then bringing in the same people they would‚Äôve recruited under DEI initiatives. Instead of publicly defying the government they make all their decisions proprietary and behind closed doors away from the prying eyes of the federal government. ‚ÄúWhy‚Äôd you select such a diverse range of candidates for these scholarships?‚Äù ‚ÄúOh we just liked them‚Ä¶ a lot‚Ä¶ just like a lot a lot‚Ä¶‚Äù Genius idea considering if the party in power switches Donald‚Äôs executive orders are all ripe for repealing and they can just restart their DEI stuff.

Or didn‚Äôt vote.

They can sue, what Trunp is doing isn't legal

*thank Trump

Still would be nice for the administration to make a stand for marginalized people‚Ä¶ But as long as they foster an accepting and diverse culture I get feigned compliance to avoid being targeted.

Blatantly standing up to the Trump administration is not something that you want a state agency to do, especially when funding is involved. Leave the standing up to Trump to the elected officials, not the bureaucrats.

unfortunately it is about money! as always! the federal government has been ending funding for basically anything that promotes DEI. So if universities want to keep receiving federal funding, they will likely eliminate their DEI programs rather than devoting their precious resources to push for what would actually be good for students! also, members of jmu's board of visitors (who issued this resolution) are appointed by VA governor- currently conservative Glenn Youngkin

If it's like other public agencies that I've seen, they didn't actually eliminate anything. All they did was make the "bad" department disappear, while transferring all of the functions of that department to other parts of the agency. So at the end of the day, a few people changed job titles and got new business cards, and that was about it.

Hopeful perspective, fingers crossed!

100% correct I'm glad somebody knows the truth.

Princeton is a private school, while JMU is public. Private schools have a lot more leeway on standing up for some things because they are independent, and not an arm of the state government.

Yep. Like WMATA up in DC, it sounds like they're just rearranging a few titles and continuing the same initiatives under other names.

That part. The people who didn't vote at all are very much a part of the problem.

It‚Äôs sad because I don‚Äôt think 99% of the administration even understands what DEI is or means. I saw Pete Hegseth talk about DEI budget cuts recently but he then referred to climate related programs. Basically anything that they don‚Äôt like = DEI.

That's about what I expected. And yet the usual suspects on Reddit and the Facebook page are losing their crap over it. Let no opportunity to virtue signal go to waste.

anyone know what's happening?

Suicide. Someone jumped off the top. Overheard some police talking about it.

this is heartbreaking. to every person reading this please know you are so loved ü§ç

I don‚Äôt know how to put this gently, but suicide hotline numbers and more counseling at JMU isn‚Äôt what‚Äôs going to solve this.

Suicide from the top of the parking deck.

Remember when JMU said last year they were making cutbacks on their counseling services?

I'm part of an alumni group on FB. The editor of The Breeze popped on and asked if we had quotes. The post was shut down right after that. Pretty hard to have quotes from alumni if alumni don't know what TF is happening. What exactly is going on down there? From what I gather here, it was two suicides in a week. Two suicides in a week is a tragedy that needs to be talked about. My heart goes out to the families and friends of the students involved. No parent should bury their child. It's a tragedy for which there is no word in the English language. Maybe the mod of the FB group thought it was better to stop discussion. I can respect their reasoning. But tell us. Please.

So there was another student just this week?

Alger just sent an email addressing this and the previous suicide, apparently this was not a student. Still absolutely tragic. Classes have been canceled tomorrow and there are counseling opportunities available.

Suicide, my buddy saw the body on his way back to his dorm

Did this happen at 4pm? I was on my way out when it happened Edit: By the looks of it I was already off campus by the time the incident likely happened

This is heartbreaking. I hope that JMU Addresses this.Two suicides in a week cannot be swept under the rug.

Second suicide?! Why haven‚Äôt I heard about the first one? I can‚Äôt even find anything about it, just random stuff from Twitter.

when will jmu address the clear mental health issue here & in the state as of late

Recent alum here. Clearly it seems like JMU needs to A) address what is going on and B) maybe give students a mental health day or something like that because clearly things are not well rn. Thoughts and prayers out to the families as well as anyone else involved. If you are suffering, please please reach out to someone, you aren‚Äôt alone.

There‚Äôs a petition going around for JMU to get better counseling services in light of everything happening https://chng.it/4c85CzXVLD. If the petition gets enough attention than hopefully JMU will pay more attention to what students want regarding counseling.

my sisters friend witnessed it can‚Äôt imagine

This announcement just went out from President Alger: Dear JMU Community, It is with a very heavy heart that I write to all of you tonight. We continue to process the loss of one of our students from last week and the tragedy at Bridgewater College. Today, an individual died on our campus and while it is our understanding at this time that they were not a JMU student, faculty or staff member, this has shaken all of us. We offer our deepest condolences to their family and friends. In order to give our community the time and space we need, the university will cancel Assessment Day and no classes will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 8. We will also be providing additional spaces for students to meet with counseling professionals experienced with loss during the times below on Tuesday, Feb. 8. Meeting times and locations for students: ‚Ä¢ 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Taylor 302 ‚Ä¢ 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Taylor 303 ‚Ä¢ 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Festival Conference room 7 For additional support please reach out to: ‚Ä¢ Counseling Center, 540-568-6552 ‚Ä¢ Dean of Students Office, 540-568-6468 ‚Ä¢ After-hours mental health emergency support, 540-568-6552, press "1" ‚Ä¢ Sentara RMH Emergency Department, 540-689-1414 ‚Ä¢ Self-Help resources available through the University Counseling Center ‚Ä¢ TAO mental health resources ‚Ä¢ Crisis Text Line ‚Äì Text HOME to 741741 to reach a crisis counselor ‚Ä¢ Counseling Center‚Äôs Additional 24/7 Emergency Resource Information These difficult moments can often lead to overwhelming feelings and questions. Please know that you are a valued member of the JMU community and we care deeply about each of you. I encourage you to support each other, to check in on your friends and colleagues, and to seek additional support if you feel you may need it. We are planning additional ways to come together as a community in support, solidarity and hope in the days and weeks to come. With caring thoughts, Jonathan Alger, President James Madison University 91 Alumnae Dr MSC 7608 Harrisonburg, VA 22807 president@jmu.edu

Alum with MDD here. College is hard. You have to work hard, and for what? A number on a piece of paper? Sometimes that number isn't even good. I had like a 2.6, but guess what? Almost everyone I work with and many random people I talk to tell me how clever I am. Nobody brings up their grades in the real world. Turns out it's way more compelling to do the work when you're getting paid to. You are surrounded by so many happy people, but you're not happy. That's not fair! "Happiest place in earth," kinda seems like any other place on earth, but with more drunk college kids. The happiest place on my earth came last year - in the middle of a global pandemic, during a very tumultuous political year, isolated from almost all friends including a former best friend of 10y, in a 875sf apartment I paid way too much for, with a crazy hectic work schedule - when I got my first puppy. This puppy dog fills my heart. If you tough it out, then you can find peace. You can earn your way. It might take some time after you graduate, but once you get your foot in the door the dominoes begin to fall. You can get the experience. It's a lot easier to do some bullshit work when you're getting paid to do it. It's a lot easier to sleep when you're allowed to put your work down and pick it back up on Monday. It's a lot easier to take a deep fucking breath after school. It seems so trite for me to sit here and type out, "it gets better," so I hope giving examples had more impact. I had my suicide planned. I walked by the spot every week. I had the tools in my backpack every day to string myself up. One day in particular the thing that got me out of bed at 3pm was flipping a coin and it landing on that I was going to kill myself. Now, looking back, I'm glad I came to in time. Thank you for reading my novel.

I love how the most negative people I have ever met in my life will post one of the generic posts and act like they helped something. Maybe instead of the whole student population sharing the same hotline number, you should take it upon yourself to help others in the jmu community and not be a complete ass. I have been a student at jmu for 4 years now and can count on one hand how many times I've received help from a fellow student. I also was never aware that jmu had any sort of mental health counseling until today. Pretty crazy how it takes two suicides in a week for anyone to acknowledge, or care, that mental heath is a real, very serious issue across any student population. Having lived with mental health issues, I can also say that counciling, hotlines, etc. don't help me, and most likely don't help a lot of others like people expect them to. Please don't act like this is the end all be all. It's incredibly frustrating that people will try to act like they care about the mental health of others during a tragedy like this, but continue to live their self centered, judgemental lives right after posting the story. This problem is far deeper than most people will understand, and the only way anything will ever change is if we stop degrading each other at any chance we get and respect one another. Starts one person at a time.

Just last semester one of my friends was feeling really bad mentally and went to the counseling center and they told him the wait would be 3-4 weeks before speaking to someone. The center was packed with people hoping to talk to someone. Then he got a 4 page list of people to call. He called and so many were not taking new patients. This is not acceptable! He ended up not coming back this semester to take some time off.

I graduated in 2019 but still get alerts from campus. Man, that‚Äôs sad to hear

Tragic. Praying for all of the JMU community, especially those directly connected to this person. It‚Äôs tough.

JMU has to address this now. It‚Äôs absolutely ridiculous that they were silent for the student last week in the arboretum, but there‚Äôs absolutely no excuse now. 2 suicides within a week of each other with no official statement is unacceptable.

Looks like a medical emergency, according to PulsePoint.

Their counseling is pretty shit they brought a police to escort my sister to the hospital a few years back. I rmbr it was traumatizing for her because she said she felt like she was doing something wrong.

JMUs Instagram says it wasn't a student

I pray the student last week didn't harm himself over not getting a frat interview. Those invites came out 1/31. Sounds superficial, but it can be upsetting Not getting accepted is an awful feeling and can really damage someone‚Äôs psyche.

Has any information been released on who was the person that died? Does anyone know?

Harrisonburg Community Health Center has great counselors. My daughter goes there and she loves talking to her counselor and she doesn't like talking to people. My heart ‚ù§Ô∏è goes out to all students on JMU campus. Please talk to someone anybody. üôèüôè

Is this confirmed? Jesus is that two suicides in a week? Wtf is going on this semester, fucking tragic Edit: Suicide Prevention Hotline is 800-273-8255, *please* reach out, anyone, if you are experiencing a crisis or think you may be, and are in need of someone to talk to. You are not alone. There are people who care, and your life is worth living, no matter what it feels like right now.

Where is this

Yup. The state of mental health in the world today is pretty abysmal. COVID ruined so many things, student debt is a crisis, the job market is horrible, social media is ridiculously unhealthy, etc. Something huge needs to change, & not just at JMU. I don‚Äôt think anybody knows what that change is, though, or if it even exists.

While it may not solve it, it would certainly help. I went to the counseling center last semester and told them I was having regular suicidal thoughts. I was told they had too many students seeking help to get me an appointment. They tried finding a place for me to go outside of JMU but with my mom's job, our insurance isn't great, and I'm unable to afford counseling out of pocket. I haven't spoken to anyone yet. The most I've heard is a couple follow up emails from a case manager to try and find more options in the community.

But what will, though?

They don‚Äôt have enough staff. It wasn‚Äôt by choice there‚Äôs just so many people who need the help and not enough counselors.

Don‚Äôt think those services would make a difference in some cases

What you can find on this post is basically all anyone knows at this point.

Same, I had no idea until this post :(

A freshman, found in the arboretum and ruled a suicide, on the 31st I believe. It‚Äôs absolutely horrible.

Aren‚Äôt classes already cancelled tomorrow due to assessment day?

Hugs to your friend. Check in on him frequently over the next few weeks or months... that's a lot to process and almost certainly will take an emotional toll.

i posted this right when it was happening. don't remember exactly but somewhere around 4:30

The other student is getting an obit in the Breeze, it‚Äôs not really being swept under the rug just being respectful of the family‚Äôs wishes. There is clearly a mental health issue on campus though and they really need to address it

According to the Breeze the person that jumped was not affiliated with the University. But still tragic.

not sure if this was the one from last week, but it seems to fit, https://www.legacy.com/us/obituaries/pilotonline/name/dylan-rowell-obituary?id=32668760

His family understandably didn‚Äôt want a lot of attention so JMU kept it on the down low

I can‚Äôt find anything either.

the family wanted their privacy to be respected

you guys fell for JMU's propaganda notice how there's non socially distanced events taking place on campus and JMU doesn't seem to care? notice how the entire tone of the administration has been saying that if we want to stay its up to the students behavior? &#x200B; it's because their entire plan behind closed doors was to pin the blame of sending everyone home on the students &#x200B; the truth is, there is no way everyone WASN'T going to be sent home, they just didn't want to be to blame. stop being alger's footsoldiers and blaming and reporting fellow students. put the blame on the ADMINISTRATION, and don't fall for their PR tricks.

ITS ALL A PR SCAM

Or that time they covered up that football player hitting that girl on the bike in front of grace, I watched that happened and then it was like it never happened

I would suggest you also look at how much administrative staff with no teaching responsibilities make, and then look at how many adjuncts teach at JMU and how much they make. You are absolutely right that the plan all along has been to blame this on students. It‚Äôs happening in schools across the state. Writers in higher ed publications and blogs have been saying this all summer. Our current financial model for higher ed is unsustainable. Period. Covid just gave the house of cards a nudge, and schools blame the students.

Most people here have believed all along there was no chance we'd make it more than 2 weeks or so, but the alternatives for what to do this fall are sparse. Job market is terrible and community college isn't really an option for most upperclassmen. The sooner students graduate, the sooner they distance themselves from the administration.

Am I the only one that‚Äôs kinda nervous to go back tomorrow? I feel this gloom like shit isn‚Äôt gonna be right. Don‚Äôt even want to buy a parking pass only to get sent home in a few weeks

addtionally, anyone else remember when JMU covered up multiple rapes AND tried to cover up the hypnotist giving everyone PTSD last frog week AND covered up one of their football players doing some sketchy abusive stuff? these people are CROOKED

With the exception of mask wearing, if you went through campus this week, you would've never guessed JMU admin even knew there was a virus. Why the hell were freshman required to walk around in 15 person groups? Why were there so many in-person activities being offered BY THE SCHOOL? JMU isn't even good at robbing students, otherwise they'd try to do everything in their power to keep people on campus until Sept. 14th or whenever the withdrawal date is.

This is completely beside the point but Michael Busing is the dean of COB, he‚Äôs not just a regular professor. There‚Äôd be riots in the streets if a professor got 200k lol But yeah, the administration just wants your money. While it‚Äôs still good to call out other students for being dumb, it was just a hastily planned money grab from JMU and an outbreak was always going to happen, regardless of people partying. Partying just makes it worse

I agree, but even with this, there‚Äôs still definitely a student responsibility to wear your mask and socially distance. When you all inevitably get sent home, there‚Äôs obviously going to be more that some students could have done to stop the spread, but ultimately, the blame falls on JMU for allowing students to come back in the first place.

You left off the part about Alger having his housing provided to him by the university in addition to his salary. I assume that the fancy house with the tennis court in Forest Hills is his house because it is owned by "Visitors James Madison University Medical Arts". If it isn't his house then one of the Breeze people on here should look into why the university has this property.

If you don‚Äôt wear masks it‚Äôs totally your fault....

At this point I almost feel like everyone should just be withdraw and force the state to prop up the schools. It‚Äôs despicable how ‚Äúschools‚Äù have become sports organizations.

i mean i already knew that it was for money so none of this surprises me.

this post is really surface level and uneducated, put some thought into it and notice the grand scheme, were all in a fucked up mess because of our corrupt government and mainstream media's fault.... stop bitching on admin

Yeah people who are reporting people kinda blow.. tbh there‚Äôs no way covid doesn‚Äôt spread thru the dorms and dining halls... the students who go to parties are hurting themselves more than anyone else. So why report it? You‚Äôre not gonna get this year people, just le it go

What?? Is there a report about this?

Wait what was this punching incident? When was it?

oh I do not think people should take a gap year. I'm just saying when we all get sent home, don't think that it's our fault. look at the admin salaries, that's all you need to know

Faculty and staff are feeling it too, and while there are some students in this sub trying to convince everyone it's not a big deal, there are plenty who feel as you do. I think you should definitely hold out on a parking pass as long as you can.

Honestly, since coming back to JMU my perspective on and fear of Covid has changed so much. I‚Äôm from a small town that didn‚Äôt really experience a rise in Covid, I was never scared and thought it‚Äôd be fine to go back to classes. Now that I‚Äôm here, I am scared. JMUs administrative actions have been negligent, irresponsible, and dangerous.

The fact they took no paycuts and eliminated many adjuncts seems like poor look. If we bounce back, who is willing to commit to a system that will betray it's most vulnerable. Maybe the golden handcuffs of upper admin makes them double down on keeping an unfair system alive. Getting paid more actually puts more pressure on them to sustain the model as is instead of innovating. ...Although siphoning some money to adjuncts working subsistence wages would be good. Especially now.

FYI. This isn't a JMU-specific problem. This same exact situation is happening in universities across the Southeast, Midwest, and Southwest. Education has needed reforming across the board ever since university presidents in America had a major shift away from an expertise in teaching and school administration to business and business administration. Schools are a service. Not a business. When experts in business and business administration run schools, this is what you see. Thank you for your post, OP. You've given us a stark reminder of the rhetoric the administration uses to blame students and cover up problems.

Omg I TOTALLY forgot about the hypnotist thing lmao

so basically: you can be in JMU's 15 person groups(frog groups, going to physical class, etc), but if you want to be in your own private 15 person group JMU will enter your private life and say you can't btw, I'm not arguing for people to be gathering in any group, I'm just pointing out a double standard here

I was a frog and walked around my group of 37 first-years....why did that happen???????

I was just posting the higher up salaries of people who are either admin or in pseudo admin roles, the site just had an improper listing of his role

There are some con professors close to that but they are usually pretty darn good. And for bus professors if you can teach it at a good school you could make a lot as a senior manager somewhere else.

wow didn't know that, but yeah I am pretty sure that's it

it is... you talking about the orange brick one, swimming pool, tennis court? i spent many days running around that place as a little kid...

I think OP is trying to say coronavirus is going to spread anyways just from inevitable contact in the dorms.. like if every single person followed all the rules to a T, there would still be a breakout. OP is saying it is JMUs fault for not just putting us online, and they are stealing our money while doing, AND figured out a way to make the students blame eachother when it will spread regardless.

Nope, it was literally like it never happened. I remember people talking about it for the next week or so then that was it. And a little on yik yak since it was still a little bit alive then

Sorry I‚Äôm late but no he hit her with his car!!

I completely agree. JMU has been extremely suspect in the past, but this is the most negligent thing they‚Äôve ever done, and of course Miller has been hinting at it being all on the students for months. It‚Äôs all a joke, that baseball game had 400 people with nobody wearing masks on campus.

I mean, you did say we fell for propaganda. We didn‚Äôt fall for this, we knew this would happen and there weren‚Äôt better options. EDIT: at least not better options for the students to take

The amount of backlash I got for posting a video and talking about how 10+ people are partying downtown with no masks was insane. They said ‚Äúit‚Äôs going to happen. Inevitable‚Äù as if that‚Äôs supposed to make everyone feel better

There‚Äôs also been increased faculty teaching loads with no increase in pay, although tenture-track faculty have been granted (I think) a stopped-clock year.

Honestly, a private group seems safer than what's happening on campus. At least when your with your friends, you know where they've been. Freshman have no clue what precautions the other 14 people in their group have been taking before coming on campus. I guess at least they have masks on, but a flimsy cloth mask won't really protect you after spending 8 hours in a group with a person who has coronavirus.

JMU holds us to a higher standard than they hold themselves, it‚Äôs pretty laughable eh? A bunch of adults who have had many, many years to learn right from wrong, putting all responsibility on 18 year olds who are just now getting their first taste of what life not living with their parents is like. I was kinda on the ‚Äúcome on guys JMU is trying their best‚Äù boat up until I received that ghastly email from Alger that was clearly a thinly veiled attempt at shifting the blame to us when classes inevitably move online. I‚Äôm just glad I‚Äôm a 5th year who decided to commute from home this year to save money instead of getting an apartment.

400 people even allowed into JMU events in the first place (based on the tone they've put out) oh, but 11 person student parties are the problem

I've seen too much "look at this group of 13 people hanging out" and not enough "why are we even back in the first place if the pandemic is as bad as JMU is acting like it is and why is jmu having giant baseball games with maskless gatherings on campus"

I know there was an option for that.

The "look at this group of 13 people" posts are pretty new, mainly from the last week or so. It's been "why are we even back" posts all dang summer.

when you register for your last gen ed

I feel like an outlier for taking health 100 with Dr. Stickney fall freshman year

Easiest class of my life

I keep forgetting I‚Äôm in a KIN class this semester

I took it with Dr. Sutton fall freshman year

sounds rough online

JMU changes withdraw deadline to October 10th.

Credit where credit is due.

Makes me feel *slightly* better.

That really destroys all of our conspiracy theories and predictions. Which is probably why they did it... But credit where credit is due.

this made me feel ‚Äúcautiously optimistic‚Äù.

now here is the question: will the withdraw date being later effect refund amounts? genuine question

You have to respect this actually

O‚Äô ye of little faith, I can‚Äôt believe you guys thought I would send everyone home as soon as the withdrawal deadline passed.

Where was this posted? I can't find confirmation on the Registrar's website.

Yes. https://www.jmu.edu/ubo/Withdrawal-Policy-Fall-2020.shtml

They sent the information through your dukes email.

Wow, this should be bigger news

Happened right on the quad

There was a video on JMU barstool if someone doing this on the steps by d hall but with the other kind of scooter.

Outstanding recovery right there.

Photos of the Quad Cats in their new home!

Im gonna miss seeing them so so much, but it makes me super happy that they're safe, happy, and carefd for in their new home :)

Awwww! Thank you so much for sharing these photos!

What happened to the quad cats?

They were rehomed! https://www.reddit.com/r/jmu/comments/pt9c4d/quad\_cat\_update/

Quad Cat Update! As some of you have already noticed, two of the Quad‚Äôs most iconic residents are missing: Jimmy and Dolley, the Quad Cats, were rehomed earlier this month and will no longer hold court in front of Burruss Hall and Carrier Library. Quad residents since 2010, Jimmy and Dolley have been unofficial main campus mascots and good luck charms. Following a bad leg injury during the summer, Jimmy was evaluated by a local vet who amputated the leg and recommended that Jimmy become an indoor-only cat. After Jimmy had recovered, caretakers picked up Dolley and took her to the vet for a health checkup before reuniting the siblings. At the checkup Dolley tested positive for feline immunodeficiency virus, or FIV, which meant being an indoor-only cat with Jimmy going forward was also in her best interests. Several people on-campus have taken care of the Quad Cats over the years, including CAL‚Äôs own Laura Wisman who has been the main coordinator for their care since 2012. Following the vet‚Äôs recommendations for both cats, Laura has adopted Jimmy and Dolley. While we will all miss the iconic pair lounging near the fountain and seeking affection from late-night library goers, they are happy and loved in their new home, and we hope they will be for many years to come. Do you have any photos of the Quad Cats? Did you get the chance to pet Jimmy or Dolley after a late night of studying in Carrier Library? Share your memories and photos with us and celebrate the Quad Cat's iconic reign!

Here's some photos. I miss them already!

i feel blessed to have had the opportunity to pet one of them, i‚Äôll miss seeing them around

i have a photo on my hand sticking out and one of them smelling it! also got to pet it, idk which one it was. passed my exam that day!

Seconding this

they were the best good luck charms ever!

There are currently no plans for an official instagram, but we will be sharing updates and photos on the JMU CAL socials every so often!

Be aware of this man‚Ä¶multiple people have already seen him this weekend

He‚Äôs been on campus for YEARS and I just now find out he‚Äôs a sex offender? üòü

Yeah this dude has been around for forever and his son was a TA for my scom class lol. He produced and distributed child porn so stay away. I feel like he shouldn‚Äôt be allowed on campus right??

Roaming around on a one wheel hover board thing with a lot of tats?

The fact that I'm a senior who has been vibin with this dude and these pups for YEARS without a clue has me absolutely shaken and disgusted.

He‚Äôs been around for quite a while, I used to pet his dogs all the time before I knew ‚òπÔ∏è

The guy with the fucking vizslas is a sex offender??? Fuck me I used to love seeing him and his dogs come to campus. Now that all jsut feels gross.

Are you able to make flyers of this guy and post it around campus, esp dorms? I would just go ahead and do it and not ask for permission. If JMU "can't do anything about it", which is BS, maybe you guys can.

if you don‚Äôt go up to him, he doesn‚Äôt come up to you. just be aware of your surroundings and stay away from him. be safe lovely humans

This needs more traction. I‚Äôve seen this dude like 1000 times all over the place and NOBODY knows this shit.

Thanks for sharing this info. I saw him on the quad yesterday with his dogs and he was riding a hover board.

Thanks for sharing! I always thought that dude was trying to be quirky and was living a life crisis but everyone I know confirmed that he was a sex offender.

This is scary...I think I saw him yesterday around the quad. He looked like just a normal dude, I never would've guessed.

I actually saw him today. 2 dogs with harnesses that look like cameras. was rolling around on a hover board like thing. Thought it was him and was confirmed after 2 girls stopped and saw him and asked if they should tell the people who were closest to him. Wow it seemed almost not real until i actually saw him

Ok but does anyone remember the creepy groomer old man janitor on east campus circa 2017/2018? He used to randomly hug girls and be all buddy buddy with us....

Ahh Hburg Townies, I miss em sometimes

He was watching a bunch of my hall mates move in üò¨

wow i know him, but would have never guess that awful truth

The RA‚Äôs say that action has been attempted to remove him but since it‚Äôs public domain, they can‚Äôt do anything

I just saw a picture of him and he is

Not sure‚Ä¶I saw him in a group of people walking yesterday with the dogs (which are identical btw) but didn‚Äôt think anything of it cause it was before I saw this. I didn‚Äôt really get a good look at him unfortunately.

me too! i feel weird now

Are we sure it's the guy with vizslas? I feel like if there are any inaccuracies with this post someone could get in serious trouble for defamation.

https://www.homefacts.com/offender-detail/VA17501/Sean-Michael-Dunn.html Here is the link to his profile. I get where you‚Äôre coming from, I was a tiny bit hesitant but there was an outpour of voices who claimed the same thing

This needs to be much higher up in the thread. People making these accusations need to practice due diligence and provide all of the information before making accusations like this that could potentially ruin someone's life. If all of the evidence proves they are what they are claimed to be, then a warning about them is perfectly fine. But those accusing need to make sure that they have all of their ducks in a row, and present all of their research. (And if this sounds like the same thing as one would do for academic work, it's the exact same concept. Make your case via your research, and lay it all out.)

Yea I‚Äôm pretty sure we‚Äôre talking about the same guy, the guy I saw the dogs were identical to and off leashes

[Are these the dogs?](https://www.breezejmu.org/culture/quad-dogs-and-owner-share-bond-with-jmu-community/article_8747e9be-b05c-11e8-a505-8f488121449e.html)

I did some double checking, between this post and the follow up screenshot of the registry [here is the breeze article with his name and the dogs](https://www.breezejmu.org/culture/quad-dogs-and-owner-share-bond-with-jmu-community/article_8747e9be-b05c-11e8-a505-8f488121449e.html) And [here is a link to the sex offender registry ](https://sex-offender.vsp.virginia.gov/sor/offenderDetails.html?regId=17501)

It's accurate information but please always use the [official source](https://sex-offender.vsp.virginia.gov/sor/offenderDetails.html?regId=17501) for this kind of information.

Relatively sure this dude was a professor at Bridgewater for some years when i was there, he was sleeping with a student.

The actual sex offender registry page for him has been posted! This is not slander, nor accusations, it‚Äôs just spreading info for new dukes and ones who had no idea!

Right it feels like something should be done. But he doesn‚Äôt approach anyone, doesn‚Äôt talk to anyone, the dogs just run up to people, so idk. He needs to definitely be removed

The guy profiled in that story has the same name as a registered sex offender in Rockingham County, VA. If these are not the dog's OP is talking about I will take this post down ASAP.

Someone else posted this link like 10 hours ago, but [here it is](https://sex-offender.vsp.virginia.gov/sor/offenderDetails.html?regId=17501) so you can see it. He‚Äôs an offender, no one‚Äôs reputation is being slandered

Those are the dogs. This may sound sketch but I know the person who posted the original warning, and can confirm it‚Äôs talking about the dude who walks those two dogs around campus, unless the guy has the same name and also walks two of those dogs around campus.

> Why are people so ready and eager to throw this random stranger under the bus without first checking the facts? It's really quite disturbing. The court of public opinion is a brutal thing. Unfortunately, too many people are quick to rush to judgment without doing any actual research, and they are also quick to criticize anyone who suggests that they actually do the research to make sure that if they're going to level a heavy accusation like this at someone that it is 100% accurate before firing. It was similarly disturbing when someone posted [to advise people not to support a bar](https://www.removeddit.com/r/jmu/comments/p1wyi6/do_not_support_dukes_the_bar_or_latins_flavor_the/) a few weeks ago because of unfounded accusations against the owner of the bar. It was ridiculous how quick people were to judge without any real proof, and also how, when I [questioned it](https://www.reddit.com/r/jmu/comments/p1wyi6/do_not_support_dukes_the_bar_or_latins_flavor_the/h8k6bcl/), the OP came back with an ad hominem attack based on television-related subreddits that I'm involved in.

He distributed child porn. And he is a tier III offender which is literally the *worst* it can get in VA. Also clearly the state doesn‚Äôt think he‚Äôs a safe person as his registration was renewed this past June. Do you think we should wait for him to hand us child pornography to make up our minds about him? Why are you bending over backwards to defend a pedophilic sex offender? I interacted with man several times before I knew his history and can confirm that it *is* him. He used to hang around outside my dorm and watch us leave and enter. Edit: Also, the reality is when you do something as evil as what he did, people aren‚Äôt going to want to be near you. Ever. You can‚Äôt fault anyone for that.

I understand that accusations shouldn‚Äôt be taken lightly but there is hard proof that this man distributed, produced, and financed child porn. Playing ‚Äúdevils advocate‚Äù here is a bad look bro

Yes, this guy is that guy. Like I said, I‚Äôve literally met him. It‚Äôs not an accusation if he‚Äôs in the sex offender registry

A bunch of photos that I took on Sunday, November 19, 2000 on campus back when I was a student

Ah the kissing rock. I found a used condom in one of the crevices last April. Stay classy Dukes.

Crazy what dhall used to look like inside. The health center still looked the same when I was there (2013)

Man....I know we all complain about the neverending construction on campus, but seeing pictures of campus pre-renovations makes me a bit more grateful for it!

RIP dhall. Had many a dash from you.

You know it doesn't look all that different. Except for old d hall of course.

Did the food get better or worse after Aramark took over?

I was there 99-03. Thanks for sharing these!! And yes RIP d-hall.

Health Center

Duuuuuuuuuukes

Dhall looked like a high school dining room before that renovation.

The quality of the food remained more or less constant, but Aramark definitely upgraded the presentation. The pre-2001 D-Hall was just a buffet, and the food was prepared in the back. The only change that Aramark made prior to the big renovation in 2001 was adding some images of food to the walls and making some "Pan Geos" stands near the fire exit. Then in 2001, they opened the kitchen area up when they renovated and did a lot of food prep out in the open.

If anyone is the Harrisonburg area needs food, please let me know. I have food and I like to cook. I‚Äôd be happy to deliver something that could last a few days. I‚Äôd also be happy to run any errands for at at-risk people who don‚Äôt want to go out.

I work evenings and I‚Äôm fortunate to still be working right now, so anything will have to work around that. Don‚Äôt need any payment.

You‚Äôre an amazing person! Thank you for helping out people in risk

The world needs more people like you

Andrew is this you
