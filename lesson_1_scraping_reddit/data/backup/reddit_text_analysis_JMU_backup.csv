comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Like him or not, he did help transform this school. Applications to JMU have drastically increased under this leadership.",2024-03-18 12:49:04,88
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Massive changes happening at JMU this year. Alger stepping down, AD Bourne retiring, Cignetti left for IU job, and rumor is Basketball Coach Byington is going to accept the WVU job",2024-03-18 12:50:05,35
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Rather short tenure as JMU presidents go. He falls under second-shortest tenure, having stayed for longer than Burruss, but shorter than Rose. I remember when JMU used to have a reputation for presidents with very long tenures, as Duke, Miller, and Carrier all stayed for 20+ years. Rose and Alger both had much shorter tenures than I had expected.",2024-03-18 13:13:29,32
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"He was very nice and friendly when I spoke to him- enjoyed being a student under his presidency, even if he did look a lil robotic ;)",2024-03-18 12:57:33,29

comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Yeah same here. He seemed kind of awkward from a distance, but every time I talked to him on campus he was really nice. Spring Break 2023 my mom came to visit on the first day and we walked around campus and ran into Alger and he talked with us for like 30 minutes.",2024-03-18 13:00:38,9
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Are you referring to this event? https://www.jmu.edu/news/2010/04/09-springfest.shtml Also, don't forget that this is a college town, i.e. the population turns over relatively quickly. If an event doesn't happen and stays gone for a few years, it is de facto extinct, because the people that remember it are all gone, and the people that are there now don't know anything about it because it was before their time. If it hasn't happened since 2010, it's as good as extinct (today's seniors were eight years old in 2010), and that's not necessarily a bad thing.",2024-03-19 12:25:30,3

comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"It sounds like it is still a step up for him, and in a direction that he's wanted to go for a while. Here's what he said in his letter to alumni: > I always tell our students to “dream big,” and this upcoming transition now represents a dream come true for Mary Ann and me. American University has an academic profile that mirrors my deep interests in national and global policy, public service and law. Mary Ann and I met just down the street from American University at National Presbyterian Church, which was where I proposed to Mary Ann, where we were married and where our daughter, Eleanor, was baptized. Mary Ann and I both lived in the Washington metro area for over a decade as we were beginning our professional careers and we have always maintained close professional and personal ties there. It is as though our lives are now coming full circle.",2024-03-19 12:40:50,3

comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,Sylvia drove this Uni into the ground. I hope President elect Jon Alger can help us,2024-03-19 04:09:54,1
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"AU and JMU are pretty different schools and cultures, so its tough to tell. I think he is a good guy and president, others disagreed. Though during his time at JMU, JMU moved up to a R2 research university, sports teams improved greatly (part of that can be attributed to Jeff Bourne), total enrollment increased 15%, and total applications increased greatly. Part of the application increase can be attributed to sports success, but he lead our transfer to a better conference. Looking at your old president's resume, he has way more experience than her and is more academically qualified.",2024-03-18 13:07:14,29
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Though I doubt an admin change will drastically change a students experience, I do think it will help the school's finances and applications. Kind of surprised American has decreasing applications, it seemed to have a good academic rep",2024-03-18 13:13:49,10
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,Really? Interesting. Why so disliked and why blamed for the drops? Did she start new policies that led to that,2024-03-19 06:44:58,1
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,Interesting. I never realized that university presidents typically change jobs that often. I wonder how much that comes from fickle boards vs. changes in opportunities.,2024-03-18 13:20:49,8

comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,As a an alumni the only thing I remember about the handling of JMU that affected me was forcing us to come back to campus during covid before vaccines were a thing to force us to pay to live in dorms and go to in person classes. I'm not saying it was his decision to bring us back but I still can't forgive the school and by extension Alger as the face of JMU for putting me in harms way.,2024-03-18 15:50:03,9
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"It dropped out of the top 100 in U.S. News rankings, which I think has had a noticeable impact on applications. Only to #105, but ""top 100"" has a prestige thing to it, especially for students who would be paying for a fairly expensive private school. Academic reputation is fairly good, especially for any major that's DC-related (politics, international relations), but it's a very uneven R2 research-wise, strong in some areas and weak in other areas. The STEM programs being small hurts rankings I think, because STEM programs usually do better in some of the metrics like grant money, paper citations, and average alum salary.",2024-03-18 17:32:06,8
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Yeah man, higher-ed presidents are turning over like no one's business. I'm honestly surprised it wasn't brought up more during the ivy league kangaroo congress hearing.",2024-03-18 15:00:31,6
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Absolutely for the best to leave it in the past. I was around for the similar event that happened in 2000, though I did not attend the event. It dominated the headlines for much of that year, and the whole thing was so dumb. The event should have never happened in the first place, though it was a traditional thing back then, and just about everyone involved handled it extremely poorly.",2024-03-19 12:55:32,6

comment,Virginia schools be like,Bruh. Shit still don’t mean we have cases. Most GMU students commute or sit in their dorms all day and with this pandemic that’s being done ten fold. Even if Kallaco is absolute shit (the same company VCU uses btw) I highly doubt GMU has many cases cause most of the students here are like wet fucking bread.,2020-09-02 15:56:48,-4

comment,Virginia schools be like,"True but I think the point is that JMU is including self reported cases in their grand total on their dashboard, but tech isn’t. So claiming that tech is doing better than us is incorrect since tech isn’t including the same numbers that we are. Almost 70% of our cases are self reported, so it’s safe to say that VT’s actual number of students with the virus is wayyyyy higher",2020-09-02 15:43:25,6
comment,Virginia schools be like,"GMU student here but not on campus this semester. They go outside to socialize, walk around, go off campus, go to dining halls, dorm study groups. Also masks are required everywhere on campus even outside.",2020-09-02 17:24:52,2

comment,Virginia schools be like,"Bro what? I wasn’t saying “all” of us do, and I’m well aware that college students like to go out and drink. Just from my observation, a lot of gmu students have recently been going to Arlington and dc on the weekends, regardless of this whole pandemic thing. Same behavior as before COVID, just now more unsettling because nobody prefers masks when they’re under the influence",2020-09-03 11:01:54,1
comment,Virginia schools be like,Ah ok I was just confused. Yeah I’ve noticed that except they go to like bars in the Fairfax area. I can’t really blame people for socializing with friends but going indoors with a mask is risking it for others.,2020-09-03 11:10:23,1

Also I checked the [TFR map here](https://tfr.faa.gov/tfr3/?page=map) when I saw you guys flying over and didn’t see a TFR over the stadium. Not a pilot though so I’m not totally sure. Are TFRs in place over every game always or just over particularly large games?,2025-08-31 11:25:08,3

comment,JMU vs WEBER STATE 8/30/25,Not technically illegal as long as you don’t fly directly over the stadium at low altitude. Definitely not a scheduled part of the game lol. When we were getting ready to take off we usually talk about where we’re gonna fly and one of the guys that lives next to the airstrip said I think JMU is playing tonight so we got amped up about flying over the game😂😂,2025-08-30 22:51:59,17

comment,JMU vs WEBER STATE 8/30/25,I’m glad you enjoyed it! We classify as ultralights so we don’t fly with transponders or identifiers so unless those cops knew us personally by wing color or could somehow pinpoint where we takeoff and land from they wouldn’t be able to do anything about it anyway.

It's pretty much what I'd expect from young people coming to terms with functioning in a society and encountering a figurehead who lacks any direct mandate from the students themselves to lead them(ignoring any supposed mandate from the state that the students almost certainly did not elect or choose), but attempts to lead all the same. tl;dr: students didn't make him president, resent his authority, reduce that to ashes with maymays on the internet because that's the only place they're still free.",2020-09-06 16:38:00,5

Without JMU we wouldn't have many of the businesses we have here, there would be no transit system to speak of, and a good chunk of the city budget would be missing (because even though JMU doesn't have to pay property taxes to the city, a check is made out to the city every year fro the amount that it would be). The city itself would be hurting, bad, were it not for JMU, there is no way around that. I'm a local that grew up here, I'm heavily involved in the community (including city government), and someone that works for the university. I can say this with absolute certainty that Harrisonburg would not be near the city it is without JMU. Those employers we have here wouldn't be here were it not for them.",2020-08-29 10:09:15,3

comment,..........,"The transit system is a Harrisonburg entity that is also a JMU owned entity that also serves EMU. I don't see it as focused on serving folks in poverty. Also, the student housing is great, but we have almost no affordable housing for low income families available in town, save the Housing Authority housing. JMU Is great in what it does for the town, it is terrible for what it does to lower income households in term of rent and housing availability. I remember well when we sold our town to JMU chunk by chunk, including the High School (and the 2nd and 3rd highschool fiasco), the Co-op, etc. In that respect, JMU has been a glorious profit opportunity for the town. But, we also have industry, and support Rockingham County families as a shopping base. I was replying to the implication that without JMU, Harrisonburg would fold. Certainly the landscape would change, but the businesses that would be hurt would be those businesses that are built for students.

comment,..........,"I believe you're getting at a critique of JMU that i hold close. The main benefit of JMU is to the businesses and those who own the property around this area rather than the community at large. A corn field being turned into student housing is a great idea from a business perspective, but if it doesn't aid those in need of affordable housing in the area but only further drives up property values it in fact makes it that much harder on those in the community.

Here is what you do, and who you contact, to get REAL consequences for that failure...","JMU Administration has failed you all. I'm an alumnus (from a while ago, but...). Here is what you do, and who you contact, to get REAL consequences for that failure... What has just happened to you all is beyond my imagination. JMU Administration failed you in every way possible. President Alger shouldn't have a job at JMU tomorrow, next semester, next year, let alone past that. But you should not just contact the administration, they already know what they did, and will just do damage control to keep your story from spreading. They're the black hole of your anger and distrust right now. Nothing at all will come out of putting your concerns there. Contacting the media is good to create a baseline set of facts and testimony, but it won't do much other than create a storm for JMU Communications to weather. So, keeping in mind that as tuition and fee-paying students you're actually *kind of untouchable* just as long as you stay calm and keep to the facts of your experience: **(1) Contact the JMU Board of Visitors.** You all need to contact the people that hired the President, approve the budget, and actually control EVERYTHING about JMU, from faculty tenure to dining services contracts to administrative appointments to approval of campus-wide initiatives to...everything: [https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/Contact.shtml](https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/Contact.shtml) The Board of Visitors is who you all need to contact. I wish I'd known that when I went there. Would have saved a lot of time. **(2) File a FOIA Request** Also, especially if you work for The Breeze (or are a student who might have some free time and above-average curiosity) and haven't already, think about keywords used by the administration in reference to the coronavirus planning and response, and then consult this site: [https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/foia.shtml](https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/foia.shtml) ...and then develop and send the relevant VA FOIA request (see ""How to: Submit a FOIA Request"" [here](https://www.va.gov/FOIA/Requests.asp)) to [foia@jmu.edu](mailto:foia@jmu.edu). They may attempt to make you pay for your university's records about their plans for you, or try to charge you ahead of time to stop your request. Don't pay a dime. If you're a student journalist and using it for those purposes, just say so and argue for an exemption to the cost. If you're not a student journalist, this can still apply to you (see the above ""How to: Submit a FOIA Request"" site for more information): >Fee Waivers Agencies may grant fee waivers if the requester successfully describes that the disclosure of information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. That's you! Press your rights and get a fee waiver. **(3) Contact the Faculty Senate:** [https://www.jmu.edu/facultysenate/](https://www.jmu.edu/facultysenate/) And ask them (specifically Faculty Senate Speaker [larsenwv@jmu.edu](mailto:larsenwv@jmu.edu)...sorry Val, it's most certainly not your fault this happened!), or create a student petition to ask them, to call for a full and secret-ballot faculty vote of (no) confidence in President Alger.

But even that exemption is largely unnecessary, because: A LOT of the records you'll be seeking are not paper records. They are just emails or Outlook meeting subjects/notes among administration, or digital server files that might contain your listed keywords. At JMU the shared file drive is the [N:Drive](https://www.jmu.edu/computing/communication-and-collaboration/network-file-storage.shtml). So, journalist or not, make sure you ask for relevant documents from the email server (I believe this is exchange.jmu.edu, but perhaps consult IT for what to call it, I bet they'd help) and the N:Drive in your request for searches. You should not accept charges for access to those documents as they would result in no photocopies. If for some reason they attempt to charge you for physical documents, amend and resubmit your request for ONLY digital documents on the mail server and the N:Drive.",2020-09-01 23:34:40,27

I am happy to hear about the scholarship aspect, if true. The JMU administration has negatively impacted all their students' lives, and given JMU a black eye that will last for years.

JMU has ALREADY had to fire 25% of adjuncts, we are still suffering from the initial quarantine. Further budget cuts result in further job losses for potentially hundreds of people. I don't think it's exactly greed in the sense that Alger is doing this all for his own reasons, but I have trouble with the argument that they needed to do this for a stable budget. Yes, that is a concern, it's still troubling when they do that and effectively fuck over students. &#x200B; I don't doubt that partying and irresponsible student activity contributed to the speed of the spread, but given the situation in the dorms and dining halls as well as crowded classrooms, I don't see how this wouldn't have spread anyway.",2020-09-02 18:07:47,1

The parking garage near where I work shows up looking like townhouses, and the row of townhouses that I live in near GAI airport looks like an apartment building. But then you go into Howard County, Maryland (the next county north), and the buildings are practically picture-perfect.

comment,I give it a week,"God I hope so. I also hope the state holds JMU and other VA schools accountable for being so reckless. They forced tens of thousands of students from all over the country to travel into the state and have ignored plenty of reasonable safety precautions. The fact that people are forced to attend in-person just to get credit for participation or to take an exam is inexcusable. If I were still a student, I'd be furious that I was spending all this money and didn't have a say in my own safety. If JMU is truly ready to go online at any moment, then classes should have just started out with that capability built-in and made in-person attendence optional. Needless to say, they won't be getting a dime from me ever again. Unlike most, I didn't have a problem with them charging full price for online classes. The faculty and resources offered still can't compete with other institutions even if classes are remote. The fact that they've buried their head in the sand and forced people into making difficult and potentially life-altering decisions just for PR is disgusting. I have very little patience these days for anyone who makes ill-informed decisions regarding COVID. We've watched the rest of the world manage the virus with reasonable success, but the U.S. can't be bothered to pivot, adapt, and follow the science.",2020-08-27 10:17:38,8

It sucked to pay full rates for online learning, but they had a budget and I'm assuming when the budget was made they never even considered a pandemic would happen. But this semester, it's obvious to all of us that a semester cannot last. It's understandable from the university's point of view: years of financially cavalier decisions have forced them to throw current students into this shitshow. This whole situation has revealed what we all already knew, but didn't want to say: the American higher education system is rotten to the core.

comment,@the selfish people who plan to party...,"I agree that the social aspect is a huge part of college, but at the end of the day students pay thousands of dollars to go here for quality, in-person instruction. Drinking culture at JMU doesn’t have to go away either. Have a dinner party and get wasted. Go on a hike with a couple friends and shotgun beers at the top. Have a few friends over and play drinking games. Fun can still be had, people are just going to have to adjust. The only type of drinking culture being taken away is massive parties and overcrowded bars. I’m not saying I don’t like these things, but being with friends does not have to happen in the basement of a frat. To be clear, in normal circumstances I don’t care how people spend their time. The main pro for in-person classes is in-person classes. Online classes suck. My girlfriend is in a graduate program here heavy on lab work and moving online will completely water down the very expensive and time intensive program she worked hard to get into. This is a reality for many students. I do agree with you that we will likely close regardless of partying or not. But if there are huge parties and those people continue to interact in the community, when students get sent home, the local Harrisonburg community will have massive spikes in cases. It is not fair for students to use their college town as a playground to do whatever they want. The main people at risk in our area will be locals of Harrisonburg. If someone goes to a 200 person party and goes to the grocery store, they are now putting responsible individuals at risk, regardless of whether JMU closes or not",2020-08-21 10:01:36,7
comment,@the selfish people who plan to party...,"Appreciate the counter argument, and glad we're in a space where you can make it. I would like to counter, though—think of the expense of college (don't even weigh it vs. the return). Just the sheer macro expense of it. Is the benefit to be at school for most students really the social scene? If that's true, is it worth paying many thousands of dollars to have a social scene? If it were, would you be satisfied? Do you have a social scene outside of school? And if not, is it worth paying thousands of dollars to have one at school? Honest questions. I posit here that the point of being in school is not the social scene. It's a really great benefit to be able to connect with peers and learn tangentially and by osmosis from being around fellow students. But I very much disagree that the benefit to be school for most students is the social scene. And for that reason, I don't think a bunch of students trying to get their 'last hurrah' in before the school is inevitably shipped to online only is a worthy reason. You said you're against partying. That's cool, and me too in this case. I just want to respectfully challenge the view that college is about the social scene. That's a luxury that folks don't generally understand they have. The primary reason one is at a university is to learn. And if it's not, what's stopping that person from spending an exponentially smaller amount of money, if any, to have a social scene.",2020-08-21 00:57:28,10
comment,@the selfish people who plan to party...,"Personally, online learning is kinda trash. Ofc online learning may be way better this semester because they actually had time to create a good plan. Anyways, I totally get that students want to socialize with people but why jeopardize the entire student body just to go to a massive party/parties. I’d rather continue doing small laidback gatherings than going to parties. But to be fair I do like smaller gathering anyways so maybe I’m a bit biased there. I would just hate to have COVID potentially spread to high risk people at a higher rate because students are going back to school. It’s a horrible and unprecedented situation and I just want everyone to be safe (and have some fun ofc)",2020-08-20 23:28:01,6

comment,“Can we get a lowered tuition rate if there is no season?” JMU: “Well yes but really no”,"> Once you graduate, drop below half-time enrollment, or leave school, your federal student loan goes into repayment. However, if you have a Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Federal Family Education Loan, you have a six-month grace period before you are required to start making regular payments. You’ll have a nine-month grace period if you’ve got a Perkins Loan. (Got a PLUS loan? You’ll go into repayment as soon as the loan is fully disbursed—which means once it’s paid out. But if you’re a graduate and professional student PLUS borrower, you will be placed on an automatic deferment while in school and for six months after graduating, leaving school, or dropping below half-time enrollment.) Per https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment Additionallyany DoE lstudent loans are not accruing interest and no payments are required until December 31, 2020 per Section 2 of https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/ Additionally there are deferment and forbearance options that students taking a gap year would likely qualify for in the worst case.",2020-08-12 13:26:06,5

comment,We have officially been ranked!,"Old alum who doesn't really pay attention to sports here! I watched the game last night and enjoyed watching us drub Arkansas State. The announcers would mention our team's bios, and a lot of them already had undergrad degrees, or ""played 5 seasons at blah blah blah"" state. I always understood the eligibility limits to be 4 years - 5 if a player is a redshirt freshman. Are we exploiting some weird eligibility loophole going from FCS to FBS and whipping other schools' asses because we're fielding 24 year-olds vs 18 and 19 year-olds?",2022-10-09 20:46:56,9

Plus you're allowed to graduate transfer (go to grad school somewhere else) for a 5th year of eligibility if you want. 5 years + the covid year = 6-year seniors.",2022-10-09 21:12:25,10

comment,We’re screwed,"There are locals taking it seriously, but you don't see us because we're staying inside. ;-) Seriously, though, the amount of people who are not wearing masks (or wearing them wrong) is definitely concerning. I'm really worried about what will happen when the students come back. It's not that I don't want you all here, but the increase in population is going to really spike our cases. My experience is that it depends on where and when you go places that determine how seriously the staff and clients take COVID. Walmart is a disaster, but if you go to Martin's, Kroger or Target during off peak hours, people are more concerned with social distancing and masks. I know that those places aren't an option for all of you, but just some observations from someone who has been here all summer.

Money can still be made by offering an off-campus option, where students can agree to pay the standard tuition but complete their classes from home.

comment,Virginia football in a nutshell,"Conferences like the American want schools with sports that excel in more than football. I think recently JMU has shown that it’s not just a football school with the success of women’s lax, softball, women’s b-ball and both soccer teams. I think it’s getting more legitimate. It’s now just a question of where the money for more scholarships will be brought in from.",2019-12-02 09:07:17,3

comment,Anybody give a rundown of what happened at that hypnotist show? Heard stuff went down there that was bad,"There’s a lot to it but I’ll briefly summarize the main stuff: The guy was really creepy and talking about sexual things with students. Throughout the show, he kept having to get an abnormal amount of people out of their “trance” because they were crying, shaking, or other things. The tipping point was when a FROG was sobbing uncontrollably, was unable to walk with assistance (she literally collapsed), and had to be escorted out. After that, the hypnotist was unable to get one of the guys out of his trance. We were all escorted out the back door and there were many police, ambulances, and fire trucks there. I’m just curious to see if the school will release a statement about it or not!",2019-08-25 01:50:18,95

comment,Anybody give a rundown of what happened at that hypnotist show? Heard stuff went down there that was bad,"Hey guys, just wanted to weigh in. I was running the sound for the hypnotist event so I spoke with Jon Wayes before and after the show in addition to witnessing the event first hand. I had never met Jon before Saturday night, but by all accounts he is a skilled performer and has been touring for about ten years. I do not believe he is a misogynist. He was attempting to build rapport with the students by resorting to ""bro"" humor. Certainly, in today's climate it was not a wise choice, but he was not trying to make anybody uncomfortable. He was a nice guy, professional, and was emotionally affected himself by what transpired. By his own admission, this event was a disaster. He simply took on too many students at once. He warned the audience in no uncertain terms that they should not volunteer if they have had past emotional problems, were under the influence, or were pregnant. It seems to me that some students ignored this warning and hence were caught unawares when they were asked to ""stay under"" for long periods of time. The vibe in the Convo was weird from the word go and Jon spent most of his time handling students that were shaking, crying, or otherwise reacting badly, which caused a cascading effect throughout the crowd. When he realized that the situation was out of control, he stopped the show and spent the next hour tending personally to any students that needed help before succumbing to tears himself. He told me that it was not unusual for participants to have negative reactions and that it happens at least once a show, but that this time it got out of hand. When we spoke after it was all over, he was visibly shaken by what had happened and especially by the treatment he received from the female staff, who felt that he paid too much attention to the young ladies in the audience, and told him so with some venom. Again, from my perspective, from speaking with him personally, I did not feel he was intentionally targeting anyone, but did make bad choices when it came to his humor delivered from the stage. Putting volunteers into uncomfortable and embarrassing situations is part of the humor of the event and I also saw many students posing with ""frozen"" volunteers to get selfies to have a laugh at later. All of the students that participated were volunteers and many could not handle what transpired. It was really unfortunate that a night of laughs ended with tears and recriminations.",2019-08-26 17:03:48,19

comment,Anybody give a rundown of what happened at that hypnotist show? Heard stuff went down there that was bad,"As a close personal friend of the Hypnotist that performed at this event, I have to say, I find this all highly unusual. He has been well trained since he was 19 under the UK Head Hackers and by Anthony Jacquin personally. He is VERY meticulous and conscious of how he preforms at every event. He even teaches other how to hypnotize professionally and to my knowledge has not had any issues, I am one of the trainees and can vouch for his training and ethics. For the guy who is saying that he is apparently untrained and everything else. Trust me he’s not, and since there are not video clips from what I’ve seen you can’t just hang a man based on hearsay. There is so much hate in the Hypnotic community already that we shouldn’t job to such accusations. I’ve yet to personally speak with him about this event. I only learned about it when a client of mine sent me the news article and asked my option. Was not until I did my research that I found out who it was. I was not there for this event but I do know how he runs his shows and what to expect. What the person above commented who did the sound for the show, described what he did and should have done based on his training. He stopped the show and attend to the volunteers that had abreactions. As for others saying that he’s a misogynistic and far from it. As the guy said before, it seems he went to the “bro humor” way which can be hit or miss with some audiences. Clearly this one was a miss. As the comment above stated, he saw he was physically and emotionally affected by this and I’m sure has replayed it over and over again in his mind trying to figure out what went wrong. He’s is a good man and a great performer. Everyone has their off days and bad shows and he’s no different. It just so happens that this one was publicized and clearly not getting the entire story. It also doesn’t help that people who know SHIT about hypnosis are commenting on different forums and attacking him thinking they know the first thing about hypnosis other that what movies have told them. I absolutely feel bad for everyone involved and it’s clear like above, some people did NOT listen to his pre talk speech and warnings. At that point that is all on them as they are adults. Furthermore, I’m sure if other people found him to be unprofessional or untrained and inept at performing. Then he wouldn’t be part of two world known entertainment agencies for several years with no issues or be able to be insured for well over a million dollars for each event in case anything does go wrong. I would personally wait until you hear his side of the story as well before making a full opinion, so that the opinion can be fully based on facts. Just my two cents.",2019-08-27 18:07:36,3

comment,Anybody give a rundown of what happened at that hypnotist show? Heard stuff went down there that was bad,"There really wasn’t any fault on either party like you said. When it comes to abreactions, you never know if or when they will happen. And then if there are ppl who have anxiety or panic attack’s and are triggered by seeing someone else experience what they think is one or is one, then you have ppl to tend to that never volunteered but still need to be brought back to a frame of mind that is good for them. From all the reports from tv, news and on here. That exactly what it sounds like happened on top of kids volunteering even AFTER the Hypnotist gave clear warnings NOT to volunteer if you suffer/experience certain issues. The Hypnotist has apologized and did admit he took on too many students. Which coupled with what sounds like happened explains why it went downhill so fast. But also didn’t help with rumors and speculation going rampaged with what didn’t actually happen. All in all the Hypnotist did what he was supposed to do and attend to all affected students individually as needed long after the show ended. So I really don’t feel/think JMU has a leg to stand on by withholding his payment. No one withheld Michael Jackson’s money when fans were legit passing out and carried away on stretchers and for physically hurt trying to get to him. Why is that? Because it wasn’t HIS fault. You can control how other ppl react to events and situations. All you can do is act accordingly in the moment and do everything you can to help. It’s clear the Hypnotist did just that. Bottom line, he deserves his payment.",2019-08-31 18:01:56,1

That tells me just how deeply it affected him on that level. It’s just sad to see such hate going around for a man I consider family and a brother. From ppl who were not there and accusing him of horrible things. As I said I’ve not heard from him on the matter and frankly don’t think I will. Until such time he feels he’s ready to share and has processed the whole situation himself. Again, I’m so sorry for everyone involved and the experience they had. It’s not typical, and it’s very rare and he did his best within his formal and professional training to react and fix the situation to the best of his abilities.

comment,Anybody give a rundown of what happened at that hypnotist show? Heard stuff went down there that was bad,"My daughter was there. She was definitely weirded out seeing so many people reacting like that. She herself started feeling dizzy and very tired, so she opened her eyes to keep from being hypnotised. The feeling scared her. That's the first time I knew or even thought hypnosis is real. As for the school, they're not covering anything up. They've asked people to voluntarily refrain from posting videos because there are kids on the videos in distress, some appearing unconscious, draped over chairs (I saw video posted privately by my daughter). Parents of these kids would be upset if they saw those videos before they knew what happened and that their kid was OK. And even then, they would not want their kids exposed like that. I would certainly want people to not share it if my daughter was in a video like that. EDIT: On further thought, I don't know that anyone from the school asked people to remove videos from posts. I saw a parent ask that. She was an administrator of an unofficial Facebook group for parents (there is a separate official group run by the school). She asked people to voluntarily not share videos privately for the reasons I stated above, and said she would delete any posted to the private group).",2019-08-25 17:15:41,18

post,Stay Safe - Don't go back,"Stay Safe - Don't go back TL;DR I love the students, professors, support staff of JMU and want you all to be safe and healthy. Fuck the administration for putting you in danger. Stay home, stay safe, don't attend this semester. I am an alum and during my time I have come to love the students, staff, and professors (honestly most of my professors were pretty solid) of JMU and the Harrisonburg +valley community. You all have helped me become a better person, citizen, and professional. I have learned about topics I never dreamed of when I was growing up and learned a lot about myself. But I have come to absolutely despise JMU's administration. From continuously rising academic costs to attend, nickle-and-dime-ing students, difficulty navigating admins with regards to my chronic illness, consistent disregard for diversity, inability to handle sexual harassment cases and for prioritizing unsustainable construction and expansion over the quality and cost of your education, there is no love for JMU's administration from me. They now have added another item why I will never donate or promote JMU as an institution and that is the bullshit way that they are handling the pandemic for the Fall semester. JMU moved to online-learning when there were 4,000 cases, but now want to open up when there are over 4.7 million total cases in the US and over 150,000 deaths. More people have died in 6 months of this virus than US combat deaths in WW1 (US involvement lasted roughly a year and a half). Schools were shut down when the attacks on 9/11 occurred, but to me it is absurd that schools would open in the middle of a pandemic that to-date has taken almost 50 TIMES MORE US LIVES THAN THE 9/11 TERRORIST ATTACKS. JMU's opening plan is not realistic, and they don't care about your health. Seriously, my office has more strict requirements than JMU's 8 day quarantine plan. My office requires 14 minimum days if you are exposed, a doctor's note, and we have been also WFH since March. How is JMU going to even enforce that? An honor-pledge? The Honor-pledge didn't stop cheating at JMU last I checked. JMU wants you to come back because that is how THEY MAKE MONEY. They are willing to trade your health/lives for cash. Believe it or not that despite the amount they charge you, JMU is strapped for cash. They have invested so much money in land/infrastructure that they need you to physically be there in order to make money from the services of the land/infrastructure (think dorms, parking, meal plans, UREC, etc.) This is the down-side of modern american higher-education. The flashy and luxurious campuses/dorms/amenities are how they attract students to come to their school and they charge you for it. It's an amenities arms-race honestly. When I did my college tours in 2013, literally every school I visited had ""inner-tube water-polo"" as a selling point. What about the academics? The reason most European universities are cheap because they are literally 5 big fucking concrete buildings that you go do hw in, take tests, study, do labs and get the fuck out from. You don't have to walk 15 minutes to get one section from campus to the other. My family from Europe has commented that my school is its own city! That's not normal anywhere else on the planet. The land and buildings aren't cheap. The school gets grants to build/buy this but guess who gets to pay the maintenance costs + taxes! You do! Going virtual would upend the years of the ""amenities"" arms-race I was talking about and make it moot. it would completely shatter the illusion you need all that land/facility/fancy bullshit that they tack on to justify increasing your tuition each year. It is not your responsibility to bear the brunt of JMU's poor financial decision-making! What can you do while not at JMU? Nothing during this pandemic is ideal, but the best we can do is mitigate a semester or two off. Take online courses/gen-eds from community colleges. It is not too late to enroll. To underclassmen/underclasswomen, you can knock out your geneds cheaper and usually easier, but make sure you check in with your registrars office first. Even if you miss the regular deadlines, Community colleges also organize some courses by first 6 weeks and last 6 weeks, you might be able to snag some of those courses; do be warned they may be accelerated. Your quality of education is already going to be crippled this year, its not worth paying all this money to start your academic career like this. To upperclassman/upperclasswomen - you can take a semester or two off. This is absolutely a valid option and don't let people bully you into not considering it! The ""you will be behind argument"" is bullshit. Behind who exactly? The millions of other people who are trying to survive this pandemic? It took me 5.5 years to graduate, I took extended time away from school for health reasons and I came back to finish what I started. If you have a direction in mind I am certain that you will complete your education even if you take a semester or two off. Again check with your registrar. I took a semester off without my loan's interest kicking in or having to re-enroll at JMU. Non-profit organizations are always looking for volunteers. Meetup dot com (sorry dont know the subreddits rule for links) is a great place to find orgs that you can network, volunteer, and practice your skillset or find one if you are willing to explore. Highly recommend, this is also how I found my current job. The risks of returning Your health, obviously, but it is a bit more nuanced than that. You could be lucky and and never catch it. You could be extremely unlucky, catch it, and die. Are those the dice you want to roll? Lets also explore the in-between options. You could be asymptomatic and pass it to no one. You could be asymptomatic and start a whole another cluster by passing it on to other people. You could get sick and recover quickly, or you could be sick and be on a ventilator for 51 days and lord-knows what other complications you could develop down the line (read the NY Times article ""51 days on a ventilator""). I don't know about you but when I went to school the most I had to worry about was catching the common cold. The quality of your education is going to suffer. Stressed and sick professors don't make for good lecturers. Chaos is not a good learning environment. You are spending exorbitant amounts of money (and loans that accrue interest!) to get less in return. My recommendation. The only way I can in good conscious recommend attending JMU this year is if everything is online and virtual. JMU has not announced that it is starting online, while UVA has. This will be the only time I endorse UVA over JMU and urge you to consider a transfer (or to any accredited school that is doing online-only during the pandemic!) or start at a Community College. Absolutely no shame in that. What JMU is doing is appalling and the implication of money > your safety is a terrible precedent to set. Closing I write this because I care. I care about the health of the students, faculty, support staff. I care about the quality of your education. You made me the person I am today and I am pissed that my own (the students,support staff, faculty) are being put in harms way unnecessarily. I care that you are getting unnecessarily fucked by the powers to be just because they said so. I learned from JMU to question authority, even if that authority is JMU. I wrote this because I cannot do nothing in the face of wrong; it would weigh on my conscious if I didn't voice my thoughts/concerns and maybe help someone stay safe. Dukes step-up.

comment,Stay Safe - Don't go back,"None of this is wrong. During a normal year, dorms are still a Petri dish. I had the worst flu of my life when I was a freshman in Hillside and with the way things are going now, there is NO foreseeable way that students on campus could be safe. Not to mention that people WILL party, WILL ignore mask rules, and you’ll be forced to live in the same confined space as them. I think the question for an upperclassmen about what to do is much more difficult, but if you’re an incoming freshman, stay home and take online community college classes. Do not pay 4X to go to a JMU summer camp for two weeks and get sent home to do the same exact thing. You will not get the freshman experience the rest of us got. No Halloween, no football, no going out, none of it.

comment,Stay Safe - Don't go back,"Good questions, I am glad you brought them up. Like I said in my post, these are not ideal times, we can only mitigate damage for the most part. If you can take your classes online - highly recommend it. If you have to fall under full-time status, do it, you have 6 months to return to full-time status before your loan payments kick in. Better to be safe than sick. You might have to take may-mester classes to ""catch up"" (catch up to what though, life is a marathon not a sprint). Whether you like it or not - you may be graduating late. This is a no-win scenario. The quality of your education is going to be affected. If you get sick or come in contact with someone who is sick, you are going to quarantine for 2 weeks and be doing classwork online anyway. I can imagine that you will be required to do multiple quarantines if multiple outbreaks occur on campus. If your professor is sick, then what? You're going to be missing instruction. If you are extremely unlucky, you'll be in the hospital where graduating on-time will be the last thing on your mind. Either way, your quality of education this semester is not going to be as good as pre-pandemic. For that reason alone it is worth postponing your plans. Let me tell you a bit about my story and why I am glad I didn't stick to my path and graduate on time. I started out music and realized a year in that I hated it. Switched majors and started from scratch. Started International Relations and hated that too. Then I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and was too ill to go to school. During my time off i recovered and found my path (IT/software dev - took a course on a whim at a community college). I am glad I took time off because 1) i could explore my career options freely 2) while I was sick I couldn't learn - I wasn't getting anything out of my education, much like how the quality of your instruction will suffer through the sheer chaos of the times we live in and how unprepared JMU was in response. They had all summer to set up infrastructure and they pissed the opportunity away. 3) I realized graduating on-time and adhering to other people's expectations and time-frames is bullshit and trying to keep up expectations/appearances was exhausting. When I was accepted into the CoB and did COB 300 I met people who were 24, 28, and 32 years old. Some were military, some dropped out earlier and decided they wanted to finish, some just took longer. Mind you Cob300 is just a bit after the halfway point in the school business majors. These people were graduating at 26, 30, 34 years old. All three of those people are doing EXCELLENT in their careers and are extremely mature professionals. It took me 5.5 years to complete and I have no regrets for it. If i stayed the course and graduated on time, I would have finished with a major I hated and I would have despised my entire time here because I was sick and not getting anything out of it. There is no shame in graduating late, pushing to graduate on time for the sake of it is not worth your well-being and health and you won't get as much out of it education-wise. You have your entire life to graduate and do good in this world. How long it took doesn't matter, especially during these strange times. There is no gradution-on-time-police. No one cares how long it took you. Do keep busy - or take the semester off. Believe me with a full time job it is harder to take vacay than I realized. Take advantage of the part-time semester or entire semester off. Finding a volunteer organization you can safely contribute is one route. I volunteered software dev at local non-profits and went to ""code and coffees"" I found at [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) (they have all since become virtual). I ended up meeting someone who hired me at these events. If you have an internship, reach out to the internship host org and let them know you can continue working with the organization if they'd have you. If you free-lance or have a side-gig, I highly recommend engaging in that. I am in no ways suggesting being idle, although that could also be a possibility. if you want to rest, take advantage of it now.",2020-08-06 14:54:29,3

Moving all the money into “totally not DEI related scholarships” and then bringing in the same people they would’ve recruited under DEI initiatives. Instead of publicly defying the government they make all their decisions proprietary and behind closed doors away from the prying eyes of the federal government. “Why’d you select such a diverse range of candidates for these scholarships?” “Oh we just liked them… a lot… just like a lot a lot…” Genius idea considering if the party in power switches Donald’s executive orders are all ripe for repealing and they can just restart their DEI stuff.,2025-04-11 21:03:44,29

Pretty hard to have quotes from alumni if alumni don't know what TF is happening. What exactly is going on down there? From what I gather here, it was two suicides in a week. Two suicides in a week is a tragedy that needs to be talked about. My heart goes out to the families and friends of the students involved. No parent should bury their child. It's a tragedy for which there is no word in the English language. Maybe the mod of the FB group thought it was better to stop discussion. I can respect their reasoning. But tell us.

comment,anyone know what's happening?,"This announcement just went out from President Alger: Dear JMU Community, It is with a very heavy heart that I write to all of you tonight. We continue to process the loss of one of our students from last week and the tragedy at Bridgewater College. Today, an individual died on our campus and while it is our understanding at this time that they were not a JMU student, faculty or staff member, this has shaken all of us. We offer our deepest condolences to their family and friends. In order to give our community the time and space we need, the university will cancel Assessment Day and no classes will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 8. We will also be providing additional spaces for students to meet with counseling professionals experienced with loss during the times below on Tuesday, Feb. 8. Meeting times and locations for students: • 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Taylor 302 • 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Taylor 303 • 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Festival Conference room 7 For additional support please reach out to: • Counseling Center, 540-568-6552 • Dean of Students Office, 540-568-6468 • After-hours mental health emergency support, 540-568-6552, press ""1"" • Sentara RMH Emergency Department, 540-689-1414 • Self-Help resources available through the University Counseling Center • TAO mental health resources • Crisis Text Line – Text HOME to 741741 to reach a crisis counselor • Counseling Center’s Additional 24/7 Emergency Resource Information These difficult moments can often lead to overwhelming feelings and questions.

comment,anyone know what's happening?,"Alum with MDD here. College is hard. You have to work hard, and for what? A number on a piece of paper? Sometimes that number isn't even good. I had like a 2.6, but guess what? Almost everyone I work with and many random people I talk to tell me how clever I am. Nobody brings up their grades in the real world. Turns out it's way more compelling to do the work when you're getting paid to. You are surrounded by so many happy people, but you're not happy. That's not fair! ""Happiest place in earth,"" kinda seems like any other place on earth, but with more drunk college kids. The happiest place on my earth came last year - in the middle of a global pandemic, during a very tumultuous political year, isolated from almost all friends including a former best friend of 10y, in a 875sf apartment I paid way too much for, with a crazy hectic work schedule - when I got my first puppy. This puppy dog fills my heart. If you tough it out, then you can find peace. You can earn your way. It might take some time after you graduate, but once you get your foot in the door the dominoes begin to fall. You can get the experience. It's a lot easier to do some bullshit work when you're getting paid to do it. It's a lot easier to sleep when you're allowed to put your work down and pick it back up on Monday. It's a lot easier to take a deep fucking breath after school. It seems so trite for me to sit here and type out, ""it gets better,"" so I hope giving examples had more impact. I had my suicide planned. I walked by the spot every week. I had the tools in my backpack every day to string myself up. One day in particular the thing that got me out of bed at 3pm was flipping a coin and it landing on that I was going to kill myself. Now, looking back, I'm glad I came to in time. Thank you for reading my novel.",2022-02-08 01:09:24,21
comment,anyone know what's happening?,"I love how the most negative people I have ever met in my life will post one of the generic posts and act like they helped something. Maybe instead of the whole student population sharing the same hotline number, you should take it upon yourself to help others in the jmu community and not be a complete ass. I have been a student at jmu for 4 years now and can count on one hand how many times I've received help from a fellow student. I also was never aware that jmu had any sort of mental health counseling until today. Pretty crazy how it takes two suicides in a week for anyone to acknowledge, or care, that mental heath is a real, very serious issue across any student population. Having lived with mental health issues, I can also say that counciling, hotlines, etc. don't help me, and most likely don't help a lot of others like people expect them to. Please don't act like this is the end all be all. It's incredibly frustrating that people will try to act like they care about the mental health of others during a tragedy like this, but continue to live their self centered, judgemental lives right after posting the story. This problem is far deeper than most people will understand, and the only way anything will ever change is if we stop degrading each other at any chance we get and respect one another.

post,Quad Cat Update!,"Quad Cat Update! As some of you have already noticed, two of the Quad’s most iconic residents are missing: Jimmy and Dolley, the Quad Cats, were rehomed earlier this month and will no longer hold court in front of Burruss Hall and Carrier Library. Quad residents since 2010, Jimmy and Dolley have been unofficial main campus mascots and good luck charms. Following a bad leg injury during the summer, Jimmy was evaluated by a local vet who amputated the leg and recommended that Jimmy become an indoor-only cat. After Jimmy had recovered, caretakers picked up Dolley and took her to the vet for a health checkup before reuniting the siblings. At the checkup Dolley tested positive for feline immunodeficiency virus, or FIV, which meant being an indoor-only cat with Jimmy going forward was also in her best interests. Several people on-campus have taken care of the Quad Cats over the years, including CAL’s own Laura Wisman who has been the main coordinator for their care since 2012. Following the vet’s recommendations for both cats, Laura has adopted Jimmy and Dolley. While we will all miss the iconic pair lounging near the fountain and seeking affection from late-night library goers, they are happy and loved in their new home, and we hope they will be for many years to come. Do you have any photos of the Quad Cats? Did you get the chance to pet Jimmy or Dolley after a late night of studying in Carrier Library? Share your memories and photos with us and celebrate the Quad Cat's iconic reign!",2021-09-22 11:00:06,114

People making these accusations need to practice due diligence and provide all of the information before making accusations like this that could potentially ruin someone's life.

But those accusing need to make sure that they have all of their ducks in a row, and present all of their research.

comment,Be aware of this man…multiple people have already seen him this weekend,"> Why are people so ready and eager to throw this random stranger under the bus without first checking the facts? It's really quite disturbing. The court of public opinion is a brutal thing. Unfortunately, too many people are quick to rush to judgment without doing any actual research, and they are also quick to criticize anyone who suggests that they actually do the research to make sure that if they're going to level a heavy accusation like this at someone that it is 100% accurate before firing. It was similarly disturbing when someone posted [to advise people not to support a bar](https://www.removeddit.com/r/jmu/comments/p1wyi6/do_not_support_dukes_the_bar_or_latins_flavor_the/) a few weeks ago because of unfounded accusations against the owner of the bar. It was ridiculous how quick people were to judge without any real proof, and also how, when I [questioned it](https://www.reddit.com/r/jmu/comments/p1wyi6/do_not_support_dukes_the_bar_or_latins_flavor_the/h8k6bcl/), the OP came back with an ad hominem attack based on television-related subreddits that I'm involved in.",2021-08-24 11:59:48,-1

I interacted with man several times before I knew his history and can confirm that it *is* him. He used to hang around outside my dorm and watch us leave and enter.
