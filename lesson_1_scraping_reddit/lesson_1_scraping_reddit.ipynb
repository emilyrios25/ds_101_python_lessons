    "## Reddit API Authentication\n",
    "\n",
    "### Overview\n",
    "Reddit allows users to \"scrape\" data from their website using an API (Application Programming Interface). Because \"scraping\" can be taxing on their servers, you have to authenticate as a user to scrape more posts per minute. The script below authenticates you as a user so you can \"scrape\" (download posts) at a higher limit. If you are not authenticated, you can still get data, but it's slower.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Two Authentication Methods:\n",
    "\n",
    "| Method | Rate Limit | Best For |\n",
    "|--------|------------|----------|\n",
    "| **Authenticated (Encrypted)** | 600 requests/minute | Large subreddits, many posts |\n",
    "| **Anonymous (Read-only)** | 60 requests/minute | Single threads, small datasets |\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔒 Security:\n",
    "I have set up **encrypted credentials** that give you higher rate limits while keeping the actual login details secure. All of this authentication code has been hidden from you in a separate module.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🔧 Setup:\n",
    "The authentication cell below will **automatically** choose the best available method - no setup needed on your end! All the complex authentication code is hidden in a separate file to keep things simple."

    "## 🎯 Simplified Text Scraper for Topic Modeling\n",
    "\n",
    "### 📝 What This Does:\n",
    "This streamlined version focuses on **clean text extraction** for analysis tools like Voyant:\n",
    "- **No duplicates**: Each piece of text appears only once\n",
    "- **Clean format**: Text optimized for analysis\n",
    "- **Two outputs**: CSV for data analysis + TXT file for Voyant\n",
    "\n",
    "### \udd27 Quick Setup:\n",
    "1. **Change subreddit**: `subreddit_name = \"JMU\"`\n",
    "2. **Set post count**: `num_posts = 100` \n",
    "3. **Choose sorting**: `sort_method = \"hot\"`\n",
    "4. **Run both cells above**\n",
    "\n",
    "### \udcca What You Get:\n",
    "\n",
    "#### CSV File Contains:\n",
    "- **type**: \"post\" or \"comment\"\n",
    "- **title**: Thread title (for context)\n",
    "- **text**: The actual text content\n",
    "- **date**: When it was posted\n",
    "- **score**: Reddit score\n",
    "\n",
    "#### TXT File Contains:\n",
    "- Pure text, one item per line\n",
    "- Perfect for uploading directly to Voyant\n",
    "- No metadata, just content\n",
    "\n",
    "### 🎯 Perfect for Topic Modeling:\n",
    "- **Voyant Tools**: Upload the .txt file directly\n",
    "- **Other text analysis**: Use the .csv file\n",
    "- **Clean data**: Removed duplicates and empty entries\n",
    "- **Focused content**: Just the text you need\n",
    "\n",
    "### 💡 Analysis Tips:\n",
    "- **Voyant**: Use the .txt file for word clouds, trends, correlations\n",
    "- **Text length**: Longer texts work better for topic modeling\n",
    "- **Sample size**: 50-100 posts usually gives good results\n",
    "- **Time periods**: Try different sorting methods to see trends\n",
    "\n",
    "This approach gives you exactly what you need for text analysis without the complexity!"
