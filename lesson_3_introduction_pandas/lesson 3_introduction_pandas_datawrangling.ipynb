         "It dropped out of the top 100 in U.S. News rankings, which I think has had a noticeable impact on applications. Only to #105, but \"top 100\" has a prestige thing to it, especially for students who would be paying for a fairly expensive private school. Academic reputation is fairly good, especially for any major that's DC-related (politics, international relations), but it's a very uneven R2 research-wise, strong in some areas and weak in other areas. The STEM programs being small hurts rankings I think, because STEM programs usually do better in some of the metrics like grant money, paper citations, and average alum salary.",

         "Absolutely for the best to leave it in the past. I was around for the similar event that happened in 2000, though I did not attend the event. It dominated the headlines for much of that year, and the whole thing was so dumb. The event should have never happened in the first place, though it was a traditional thing back then, and just about everyone involved handled it extremely poorly.",

         "Rather short tenure as JMU presidents go. He falls under second-shortest tenure, having stayed for longer than Burruss, but shorter than Rose. I remember when JMU used to have a reputation for presidents with very long tenures, as Duke, Miller, and Carrier all stayed for 20+ years. Rose and Alger both had much shorter tenures than I had expected.",
