comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Like him or not, he did help transform this school. Applications to JMU have drastically increased under this leadership.",2024-03-18 12:49:04,82
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Massive changes happening at JMU this year. Alger stepping down, AD Bourne retiring, Cignetti left for IU job, and rumor is Basketball Coach Byington is going to accept the WVU job",2024-03-18 12:50:05,34
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Rather short tenure as JMU presidents go. He falls under second-shortest tenure, having stayed for longer than Burruss, but shorter than Rose. I remember when JMU used to have a reputation for presidents with very long tenures, as Duke, Miller, and Carrier all stayed for 20+ years. Rose and Alger both had much shorter tenures than I had expected.",2024-03-18 13:13:29,37

comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Yeah same here. He seemed kind of awkward from a distance, but every time I talked to him on campus he was really nice.

comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Are you referring to this event? https://www.jmu.edu/news/2010/04/09-springfest.shtml Also, don't forget that this is a college town, i.e. the population turns over relatively quickly. If an event doesn't happen and stays gone for a few years, it is de facto extinct, because the people that remember it are all gone, and the people that are there now don't know anything about it because it was before their time. If it hasn't happened since 2010, it's as good as extinct (today's seniors were eight years old in 2010), and that's not necessarily a bad thing.",2024-03-19 12:25:30,3

comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"It sounds like it is still a step up for him, and in a direction that he's wanted to go for a while. Here's what he said in his letter to alumni: > I always tell our students to “dream big,” and this upcoming transition now represents a dream come true for Mary Ann and me. American University has an academic profile that mirrors my deep interests in national and global policy, public service and law. Mary Ann and I met just down the street from American University at National Presbyterian Church, which was where I proposed to Mary Ann, where we were married and where our daughter, Eleanor, was baptized. Mary Ann and I both lived in the Washington metro area for over a decade as we were beginning our professional careers and we have always maintained close professional and personal ties there. It is as though our lives are now coming full circle.",2024-03-19 12:40:50,3

comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"AU and JMU are pretty different schools and cultures, so its tough to tell. I think he is a good guy and president, others disagreed. Though during his time at JMU, JMU moved up to a R2 research university, sports teams improved greatly (part of that can be attributed to Jeff Bourne), total enrollment increased 15%, and total applications increased greatly. Part of the application increase can be attributed to sports success, but he lead our transfer to a better conference. Looking at your old president's resume, he has way more experience than her and is more academically qualified.",2024-03-18 13:07:14,31
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Though I doubt an admin change will drastically change a students experience, I do think it will help the school's finances and applications. Kind of surprised American has decreasing applications, it seemed to have a good academic rep",2024-03-18 13:13:49,10
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,Really? Interesting. Why so disliked and why blamed for the drops? Did she start new policies that led to that,2024-03-19 06:44:58,1
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,Interesting. I never realized that university presidents typically change jobs that often. I wonder how much that comes from fickle boards vs. changes in opportunities.,2024-03-18 13:20:49,8

comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,As a an alumni the only thing I remember about the handling of JMU that affected me was forcing us to come back to campus during covid before vaccines were a thing to force us to pay to live in dorms and go to in person classes. I'm not saying it was his decision to bring us back but I still can't forgive the school and by extension Alger as the face of JMU for putting me in harms way.,2024-03-18 15:50:03,11
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"It dropped out of the top 100 in U.S. News rankings, which I think has had a noticeable impact on applications. Only to #105, but ""top 100"" has a prestige thing to it, especially for students who would be paying for a fairly expensive private school. Academic reputation is fairly good, especially for any major that's DC-related (politics, international relations), but it's a very uneven R2 research-wise, strong in some areas and weak in other areas. The STEM programs being small hurts rankings I think, because STEM programs usually do better in some of the metrics like grant money, paper citations, and average alum salary.",2024-03-18 17:32:06,8
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Yeah man, higher-ed presidents are turning over like no one's business. I'm honestly surprised it wasn't brought up more during the ivy league kangaroo congress hearing.",2024-03-18 15:00:31,7
comment,President Alger leaving to take same job at American University at the end of this academic year,"Absolutely for the best to leave it in the past. I was around for the similar event that happened in 2000, though I did not attend the event. It dominated the headlines for much of that year, and the whole thing was so dumb. The event should have never happened in the first place, though it was a traditional thing back then, and just about everyone involved handled it extremely poorly.",2024-03-19 12:55:32,6

comment,Virginia schools be like,Bruh. Shit still don’t mean we have cases. Most GMU students commute or sit in their dorms all day and with this pandemic that’s being done ten fold. Even if Kallaco is absolute shit (the same company VCU uses btw) I highly doubt GMU has many cases cause most of the students here are like wet fucking bread.,2020-09-02 15:56:48,-2

comment,Virginia schools be like,"True but I think the point is that JMU is including self reported cases in their grand total on their dashboard, but tech isn’t. So claiming that tech is doing better than us is incorrect since tech isn’t including the same numbers that we are. Almost 70% of our cases are self reported, so it’s safe to say that VT’s actual number of students with the virus is wayyyyy higher",2020-09-02 15:43:25,7

comment,Virginia schools be like,"Bro what? I wasn’t saying “all” of us do, and I’m well aware that college students like to go out and drink. Just from my observation, a lot of gmu students have recently been going to Arlington and dc on the weekends, regardless of this whole pandemic thing. Same behavior as before COVID, just now more unsettling because nobody prefers masks when they’re under the influence",2020-09-03 11:01:54,1
comment,Virginia schools be like,Ah ok I was just confused. Yeah I’ve noticed that except they go to like bars in the Fairfax area. I can’t really blame people for socializing with friends but going indoors with a mask is risking it for others.,2020-09-03 11:10:23,1

It's pretty much what I'd expect from young people coming to terms with functioning in a society and encountering a figurehead who lacks any direct mandate from the students themselves to lead them(ignoring any supposed mandate from the state that the students almost certainly did not elect or choose), but attempts to lead all the same. tl;dr: students didn't make him president, resent his authority, reduce that to ashes with maymays on the internet because that's the only place they're still free.",2020-09-06 16:38:00,5

Without JMU we wouldn't have many of the businesses we have here, there would be no transit system to speak of, and a good chunk of the city budget would be missing (because even though JMU doesn't have to pay property taxes to the city, a check is made out to the city every year fro the amount that it would be). The city itself would be hurting, bad, were it not for JMU, there is no way around that. I'm a local that grew up here, I'm heavily involved in the community (including city government), and someone that works for the university. I can say this with absolute certainty that Harrisonburg would not be near the city it is without JMU. Those employers we have here wouldn't be here were it not for them.",2020-08-29 10:09:15,3

comment,..........,"The transit system is a Harrisonburg entity that is also a JMU owned entity that also serves EMU. I don't see it as focused on serving folks in poverty. Also, the student housing is great, but we have almost no affordable housing for low income families available in town, save the Housing Authority housing. JMU Is great in what it does for the town, it is terrible for what it does to lower income households in term of rent and housing availability. I remember well when we sold our town to JMU chunk by chunk, including the High School (and the 2nd and 3rd highschool fiasco), the Co-op, etc. In that respect, JMU has been a glorious profit opportunity for the town. But, we also have industry, and support Rockingham County families as a shopping base. I was replying to the implication that without JMU, Harrisonburg would fold. Certainly the landscape would change, but the businesses that would be hurt would be those businesses that are built for students.

comment,..........,"I believe you're getting at a critique of JMU that i hold close. The main benefit of JMU is to the businesses and those who own the property around this area rather than the community at large. A corn field being turned into student housing is a great idea from a business perspective, but if it doesn't aid those in need of affordable housing in the area but only further drives up property values it in fact makes it that much harder on those in the community.

Here is what you do, and who you contact, to get REAL consequences for that failure...","JMU Administration has failed you all. I'm an alumnus (from a while ago, but...). Here is what you do, and who you contact, to get REAL consequences for that failure... What has just happened to you all is beyond my imagination. JMU Administration failed you in every way possible. President Alger shouldn't have a job at JMU tomorrow, next semester, next year, let alone past that. But you should not just contact the administration, they already know what they did, and will just do damage control to keep your story from spreading. They're the black hole of your anger and distrust right now. Nothing at all will come out of putting your concerns there. Contacting the media is good to create a baseline set of facts and testimony, but it won't do much other than create a storm for JMU Communications to weather. So, keeping in mind that as tuition and fee-paying students you're actually *kind of untouchable* just as long as you stay calm and keep to the facts of your experience: **(1) Contact the JMU Board of Visitors.** You all need to contact the people that hired the President, approve the budget, and actually control EVERYTHING about JMU, from faculty tenure to dining services contracts to administrative appointments to approval of campus-wide initiatives to...everything: [https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/Contact.shtml](https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/Contact.shtml) The Board of Visitors is who you all need to contact. I wish I'd known that when I went there. Would have saved a lot of time. **(2) File a FOIA Request** Also, especially if you work for The Breeze (or are a student who might have some free time and above-average curiosity) and haven't already, think about keywords used by the administration in reference to the coronavirus planning and response, and then consult this site: [https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/foia.shtml](https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/about/foia.shtml) ...and then develop and send the relevant VA FOIA request (see ""How to: Submit a FOIA Request"" [here](https://www.va.gov/FOIA/Requests.asp)) to [foia@jmu.edu](mailto:foia@jmu.edu). They may attempt to make you pay for your university's records about their plans for you, or try to charge you ahead of time to stop your request. Don't pay a dime. If you're a student journalist and using it for those purposes, just say so and argue for an exemption to the cost. If you're not a student journalist, this can still apply to you (see the above ""How to: Submit a FOIA Request"" site for more information): >Fee Waivers Agencies may grant fee waivers if the requester successfully describes that the disclosure of information is in the public interest because it is likely to contribute significantly to the public understanding of the operations or activities of the government and is not primarily in the commercial interest of the requester. That's you! Press your rights and get a fee waiver. **(3) Contact the Faculty Senate:** [https://www.jmu.edu/facultysenate/](https://www.jmu.edu/facultysenate/) And ask them (specifically Faculty Senate Speaker [larsenwv@jmu.edu](mailto:larsenwv@jmu.edu)...sorry Val, it's most certainly not your fault this happened!), or create a student petition to ask them, to call for a full and secret-ballot faculty vote of (no) confidence in President Alger.

But even that exemption is largely unnecessary, because: A LOT of the records you'll be seeking are not paper records. They are just emails or Outlook meeting subjects/notes among administration, or digital server files that might contain your listed keywords. At JMU the shared file drive is the [N:Drive](https://www.jmu.edu/computing/communication-and-collaboration/network-file-storage.shtml). So, journalist or not, make sure you ask for relevant documents from the email server (I believe this is exchange.jmu.edu, but perhaps consult IT for what to call it, I bet they'd help) and the N:Drive in your request for searches. You should not accept charges for access to those documents as they would result in no photocopies. If for some reason they attempt to charge you for physical documents, amend and resubmit your request for ONLY digital documents on the mail server and the N:Drive.",2020-09-01 23:34:40,25

JMU has ALREADY had to fire 25% of adjuncts, we are still suffering from the initial quarantine. Further budget cuts result in further job losses for potentially hundreds of people. I don't think it's exactly greed in the sense that Alger is doing this all for his own reasons, but I have trouble with the argument that they needed to do this for a stable budget. Yes, that is a concern, it's still troubling when they do that and effectively fuck over students. &#x200B; I don't doubt that partying and irresponsible student activity contributed to the speed of the spread, but given the situation in the dorms and dining halls as well as crowded classrooms, I don't see how this wouldn't have spread anyway.",2020-09-02 18:07:47,1

The parking garage near where I work shows up looking like townhouses, and the row of townhouses that I live in near GAI airport looks like an apartment building. But then you go into Howard County, Maryland (the next county north), and the buildings are practically picture-perfect.

comment,I give it a week,"God I hope so. I also hope the state holds JMU and other VA schools accountable for being so reckless. They forced tens of thousands of students from all over the country to travel into the state and have ignored plenty of reasonable safety precautions. The fact that people are forced to attend in-person just to get credit for participation or to take an exam is inexcusable. If I were still a student, I'd be furious that I was spending all this money and didn't have a say in my own safety. If JMU is truly ready to go online at any moment, then classes should have just started out with that capability built-in and made in-person attendence optional. Needless to say, they won't be getting a dime from me ever again. Unlike most, I didn't have a problem with them charging full price for online classes. The faculty and resources offered still can't compete with other institutions even if classes are remote. The fact that they've buried their head in the sand and forced people into making difficult and potentially life-altering decisions just for PR is disgusting. I have very little patience these days for anyone who makes ill-informed decisions regarding COVID. We've watched the rest of the world manage the virus with reasonable success, but the U.S. can't be bothered to pivot, adapt, and follow the science.",2020-08-27 10:17:38,7

It sucked to pay full rates for online learning, but they had a budget and I'm assuming when the budget was made they never even considered a pandemic would happen. But this semester, it's obvious to all of us that a semester cannot last. It's understandable from the university's point of view: years of financially cavalier decisions have forced them to throw current students into this shitshow. This whole situation has revealed what we all already knew, but didn't want to say: the American higher education system is rotten to the core.

comment,@the selfish people who plan to party...,"I agree that the social aspect is a huge part of college, but at the end of the day students pay thousands of dollars to go here for quality, in-person instruction. Drinking culture at JMU doesn’t have to go away either. Have a dinner party and get wasted. Go on a hike with a couple friends and shotgun beers at the top. Have a few friends over and play drinking games. Fun can still be had, people are just going to have to adjust. The only type of drinking culture being taken away is massive parties and overcrowded bars. I’m not saying I don’t like these things, but being with friends does not have to happen in the basement of a frat. To be clear, in normal circumstances I don’t care how people spend their time. The main pro for in-person classes is in-person classes. Online classes suck. My girlfriend is in a graduate program here heavy on lab work and moving online will completely water down the very expensive and time intensive program she worked hard to get into. This is a reality for many students. I do agree with you that we will likely close regardless of partying or not. But if there are huge parties and those people continue to interact in the community, when students get sent home, the local Harrisonburg community will have massive spikes in cases. It is not fair for students to use their college town as a playground to do whatever they want. The main people at risk in our area will be locals of Harrisonburg. If someone goes to a 200 person party and goes to the grocery store, they are now putting responsible individuals at risk, regardless of whether JMU closes or not",2020-08-21 10:01:36,6
comment,@the selfish people who plan to party...,"Appreciate the counter argument, and glad we're in a space where you can make it. I would like to counter, though—think of the expense of college (don't even weigh it vs. the return). Just the sheer macro expense of it. Is the benefit to be at school for most students really the social scene? If that's true, is it worth paying many thousands of dollars to have a social scene? If it were, would you be satisfied? Do you have a social scene outside of school? And if not, is it worth paying thousands of dollars to have one at school? Honest questions. I posit here that the point of being in school is not the social scene. It's a really great benefit to be able to connect with peers and learn tangentially and by osmosis from being around fellow students. But I very much disagree that the benefit to be school for most students is the social scene. And for that reason, I don't think a bunch of students trying to get their 'last hurrah' in before the school is inevitably shipped to online only is a worthy reason. You said you're against partying. That's cool, and me too in this case. I just want to respectfully challenge the view that college is about the social scene. That's a luxury that folks don't generally understand they have. The primary reason one is at a university is to learn. And if it's not, what's stopping that person from spending an exponentially smaller amount of money, if any, to have a social scene.",2020-08-21 00:57:28,9
comment,@the selfish people who plan to party...,"Personally, online learning is kinda trash. Ofc online learning may be way better this semester because they actually had time to create a good plan. Anyways, I totally get that students want to socialize with people but why jeopardize the entire student body just to go to a massive party/parties. I’d rather continue doing small laidback gatherings than going to parties. But to be fair I do like smaller gathering anyways so maybe I’m a bit biased there. I would just hate to have COVID potentially spread to high risk people at a higher rate because students are going back to school. It’s a horrible and unprecedented situation and I just want everyone to be safe (and have some fun ofc)",2020-08-20 23:28:01,6

comment,“Can we get a lowered tuition rate if there is no season?” JMU: “Well yes but really no”,"> Once you graduate, drop below half-time enrollment, or leave school, your federal student loan goes into repayment. However, if you have a Direct Subsidized, Direct Unsubsidized, or Federal Family Education Loan, you have a six-month grace period before you are required to start making regular payments. You’ll have a nine-month grace period if you’ve got a Perkins Loan. (Got a PLUS loan? You’ll go into repayment as soon as the loan is fully disbursed—which means once it’s paid out. But if you’re a graduate and professional student PLUS borrower, you will be placed on an automatic deferment while in school and for six months after graduating, leaving school, or dropping below half-time enrollment.) Per https://studentaid.gov/manage-loans/repayment Additionallyany DoE lstudent loans are not accruing interest and no payments are required until December 31, 2020 per Section 2 of https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/memorandum-continued-student-loan-payment-relief-covid-19-pandemic/ Additionally there are deferment and forbearance options that students taking a gap year would likely qualify for in the worst case.",2020-08-12 13:26:06,4

The announcers would mention our team's bios, and a lot of them already had undergrad degrees, or ""played 5 seasons at blah blah blah"" state. I always understood the eligibility limits to be 4 years - 5 if a player is a redshirt freshman.

Plus you're allowed to graduate transfer (go to grad school somewhere else) for a 5th year of eligibility if you want. 5 years + the covid year = 6-year seniors.",2022-10-09 21:12:25,10

comment,We’re screwed,"There are locals taking it seriously, but you don't see us because we're staying inside. ;-) Seriously, though, the amount of people who are not wearing masks (or wearing them wrong) is definitely concerning. I'm really worried about what will happen when the students come back. It's not that I don't want you all here, but the increase in population is going to really spike our cases. My experience is that it depends on where and when you go places that determine how seriously the staff and clients take COVID. Walmart is a disaster, but if you go to Martin's, Kroger or Target during off peak hours, people are more concerned with social distancing and masks. I know that those places aren't an option for all of you, but just some observations from someone who has been here all summer.

Money can still be made by offering an off-campus option, where students can agree to pay the standard tuition but complete their classes from home.

comment,Virginia football in a nutshell,"Conferences like the American want schools with sports that excel in more than football. I think recently JMU has shown that it’s not just a football school with the success of women’s lax, softball, women’s b-ball and both soccer teams. I think it’s getting more legitimate.

comment,Anybody give a rundown of what happened at that hypnotist show? Heard stuff went down there that was bad,"There’s a lot to it but I’ll briefly summarize the main stuff: The guy was really creepy and talking about sexual things with students. Throughout the show, he kept having to get an abnormal amount of people out of their “trance” because they were crying, shaking, or other things. The tipping point was when a FROG was sobbing uncontrollably, was unable to walk with assistance (she literally collapsed), and had to be escorted out. After that, the hypnotist was unable to get one of the guys out of his trance. We were all escorted out the back door and there were many police, ambulances, and fire trucks there. I’m just curious to see if the school will release a statement about it or not!",2019-08-25 01:50:18,94

comment,Anybody give a rundown of what happened at that hypnotist show? Heard stuff went down there that was bad,"Hey guys, just wanted to weigh in. I was running the sound for the hypnotist event so I spoke with Jon Wayes before and after the show in addition to witnessing the event first hand. I had never met Jon before Saturday night, but by all accounts he is a skilled performer and has been touring for about ten years. I do not believe he is a misogynist. He was attempting to build rapport with the students by resorting to ""bro"" humor. Certainly, in today's climate it was not a wise choice, but he was not trying to make anybody uncomfortable. He was a nice guy, professional, and was emotionally affected himself by what transpired. By his own admission, this event was a disaster. He simply took on too many students at once. He warned the audience in no uncertain terms that they should not volunteer if they have had past emotional problems, were under the influence, or were pregnant. It seems to me that some students ignored this warning and hence were caught unawares when they were asked to ""stay under"" for long periods of time. The vibe in the Convo was weird from the word go and Jon spent most of his time handling students that were shaking, crying, or otherwise reacting badly, which caused a cascading effect throughout the crowd. When he realized that the situation was out of control, he stopped the show and spent the next hour tending personally to any students that needed help before succumbing to tears himself. He told me that it was not unusual for participants to have negative reactions and that it happens at least once a show, but that this time it got out of hand. When we spoke after it was all over, he was visibly shaken by what had happened and especially by the treatment he received from the female staff, who felt that he paid too much attention to the young ladies in the audience, and told him so with some venom. Again, from my perspective, from speaking with him personally, I did not feel he was intentionally targeting anyone, but did make bad choices when it came to his humor delivered from the stage. Putting volunteers into uncomfortable and embarrassing situations is part of the humor of the event and I also saw many students posing with ""frozen"" volunteers to get selfies to have a laugh at later. All of the students that participated were volunteers and many could not handle what transpired. It was really unfortunate that a night of laughs ended with tears and recriminations.",2019-08-26 17:03:48,18

comment,Anybody give a rundown of what happened at that hypnotist show? Heard stuff went down there that was bad,"As a close personal friend of the Hypnotist that performed at this event, I have to say, I find this all highly unusual. He has been well trained since he was 19 under the UK Head Hackers and by Anthony Jacquin personally. He is VERY meticulous and conscious of how he preforms at every event. He even teaches other how to hypnotize professionally and to my knowledge has not had any issues, I am one of the trainees and can vouch for his training and ethics. For the guy who is saying that he is apparently untrained and everything else. Trust me he’s not, and since there are not video clips from what I’ve seen you can’t just hang a man based on hearsay. There is so much hate in the Hypnotic community already that we shouldn’t job to such accusations. I’ve yet to personally speak with him about this event. I only learned about it when a client of mine sent me the news article and asked my option. Was not until I did my research that I found out who it was. I was not there for this event but I do know how he runs his shows and what to expect. What the person above commented who did the sound for the show, described what he did and should have done based on his training. He stopped the show and attend to the volunteers that had abreactions. As for others saying that he’s a misogynistic and far from it. As the guy said before, it seems he went to the “bro humor” way which can be hit or miss with some audiences. Clearly this one was a miss. As the comment above stated, he saw he was physically and emotionally affected by this and I’m sure has replayed it over and over again in his mind trying to figure out what went wrong. He’s is a good man and a great performer. Everyone has their off days and bad shows and he’s no different. It just so happens that this one was publicized and clearly not getting the entire story. It also doesn’t help that people who know SHIT about hypnosis are commenting on different forums and attacking him thinking they know the first thing about hypnosis other that what movies have told them. I absolutely feel bad for everyone involved and it’s clear like above, some people did NOT listen to his pre talk speech and warnings. At that point that is all on them as they are adults. Furthermore, I’m sure if other people found him to be unprofessional or untrained and inept at performing. Then he wouldn’t be part of two world known entertainment agencies for several years with no issues or be able to be insured for well over a million dollars for each event in case anything does go wrong. I would personally wait until you hear his side of the story as well before making a full opinion, so that the opinion can be fully based on facts. Just my two cents.",2019-08-27 18:07:36,3

comment,Anybody give a rundown of what happened at that hypnotist show? Heard stuff went down there that was bad,"There really wasn’t any fault on either party like you said. When it comes to abreactions, you never know if or when they will happen. And then if there are ppl who have anxiety or panic attack’s and are triggered by seeing someone else experience what they think is one or is one, then you have ppl to tend to that never volunteered but still need to be brought back to a frame of mind that is good for them. From all the reports from tv, news and on here. That exactly what it sounds like happened on top of kids volunteering even AFTER the Hypnotist gave clear warnings NOT to volunteer if you suffer/experience certain issues. The Hypnotist has apologized and did admit he took on too many students. Which coupled with what sounds like happened explains why it went downhill so fast. But also didn’t help with rumors and speculation going rampaged with what didn’t actually happen. All in all the Hypnotist did what he was supposed to do and attend to all affected students individually as needed long after the show ended. So I really don’t feel/think JMU has a leg to stand on by withholding his payment. No one withheld Michael Jackson’s money when fans were legit passing out and carried away on stretchers and for physically hurt trying to get to him. Why is that? Because it wasn’t HIS fault. You can control how other ppl react to events and situations. All you can do is act accordingly in the moment and do everything you can to help. It’s clear the Hypnotist did just that. Bottom line, he deserves his payment.",2019-08-31 18:01:56,1

That tells me just how deeply it affected him on that level. It’s just sad to see such hate going around for a man I consider family and a brother. From ppl who were not there and accusing him of horrible things. As I said I’ve not heard from him on the matter and frankly don’t think I will. Until such time he feels he’s ready to share and has processed the whole situation himself. Again, I’m so sorry for everyone involved and the experience they had. It’s not typical, and it’s very rare and he did his best within his formal and professional training to react and fix the situation to the best of his abilities.

comment,Anybody give a rundown of what happened at that hypnotist show? Heard stuff went down there that was bad,"My daughter was there. She was definitely weirded out seeing so many people reacting like that. She herself started feeling dizzy and very tired, so she opened her eyes to keep from being hypnotised. The feeling scared her. That's the first time I knew or even thought hypnosis is real. As for the school, they're not covering anything up. They've asked people to voluntarily refrain from posting videos because there are kids on the videos in distress, some appearing unconscious, draped over chairs (I saw video posted privately by my daughter). Parents of these kids would be upset if they saw those videos before they knew what happened and that their kid was OK. And even then, they would not want their kids exposed like that. I would certainly want people to not share it if my daughter was in a video like that. EDIT: On further thought, I don't know that anyone from the school asked people to remove videos from posts. I saw a parent ask that. She was an administrator of an unofficial Facebook group for parents (there is a separate official group run by the school). She asked people to voluntarily not share videos privately for the reasons I stated above, and said she would delete any posted to the private group).",2019-08-25 17:15:41,18

post,Stay Safe - Don't go back,"Stay Safe - Don't go back TL;DR I love the students, professors, support staff of JMU and want you all to be safe and healthy. Fuck the administration for putting you in danger. Stay home, stay safe, don't attend this semester. I am an alum and during my time I have come to love the students, staff, and professors (honestly most of my professors were pretty solid) of JMU and the Harrisonburg +valley community. You all have helped me become a better person, citizen, and professional. I have learned about topics I never dreamed of when I was growing up and learned a lot about myself. But I have come to absolutely despise JMU's administration. From continuously rising academic costs to attend, nickle-and-dime-ing students, difficulty navigating admins with regards to my chronic illness, consistent disregard for diversity, inability to handle sexual harassment cases and for prioritizing unsustainable construction and expansion over the quality and cost of your education, there is no love for JMU's administration from me. They now have added another item why I will never donate or promote JMU as an institution and that is the bullshit way that they are handling the pandemic for the Fall semester. JMU moved to online-learning when there were 4,000 cases, but now want to open up when there are over 4.7 million total cases in the US and over 150,000 deaths. More people have died in 6 months of this virus than US combat deaths in WW1 (US involvement lasted roughly a year and a half). Schools were shut down when the attacks on 9/11 occurred, but to me it is absurd that schools would open in the middle of a pandemic that to-date has taken almost 50 TIMES MORE US LIVES THAN THE 9/11 TERRORIST ATTACKS. JMU's opening plan is not realistic, and they don't care about your health. Seriously, my office has more strict requirements than JMU's 8 day quarantine plan. My office requires 14 minimum days if you are exposed, a doctor's note, and we have been also WFH since March. How is JMU going to even enforce that? An honor-pledge? The Honor-pledge didn't stop cheating at JMU last I checked. JMU wants you to come back because that is how THEY MAKE MONEY. They are willing to trade your health/lives for cash. Believe it or not that despite the amount they charge you, JMU is strapped for cash. They have invested so much money in land/infrastructure that they need you to physically be there in order to make money from the services of the land/infrastructure (think dorms, parking, meal plans, UREC, etc.) This is the down-side of modern american higher-education. The flashy and luxurious campuses/dorms/amenities are how they attract students to come to their school and they charge you for it. It's an amenities arms-race honestly. When I did my college tours in 2013, literally every school I visited had ""inner-tube water-polo"" as a selling point. What about the academics? The reason most European universities are cheap because they are literally 5 big fucking concrete buildings that you go do hw in, take tests, study, do labs and get the fuck out from. You don't have to walk 15 minutes to get one section from campus to the other. My family from Europe has commented that my school is its own city! That's not normal anywhere else on the planet. The land and buildings aren't cheap. The school gets grants to build/buy this but guess who gets to pay the maintenance costs + taxes! You do! Going virtual would upend the years of the ""amenities"" arms-race I was talking about and make it moot. it would completely shatter the illusion you need all that land/facility/fancy bullshit that they tack on to justify increasing your tuition each year. It is not your responsibility to bear the brunt of JMU's poor financial decision-making! What can you do while not at JMU? Nothing during this pandemic is ideal, but the best we can do is mitigate a semester or two off. Take online courses/gen-eds from community colleges. It is not too late to enroll. To underclassmen/underclasswomen, you can knock out your geneds cheaper and usually easier, but make sure you check in with your registrars office first. Even if you miss the regular deadlines, Community colleges also organize some courses by first 6 weeks and last 6 weeks, you might be able to snag some of those courses; do be warned they may be accelerated. Your quality of education is already going to be crippled this year, its not worth paying all this money to start your academic career like this. To upperclassman/upperclasswomen - you can take a semester or two off. This is absolutely a valid option and don't let people bully you into not considering it! The ""you will be behind argument"" is bullshit. Behind who exactly? The millions of other people who are trying to survive this pandemic? It took me 5.5 years to graduate, I took extended time away from school for health reasons and I came back to finish what I started. If you have a direction in mind I am certain that you will complete your education even if you take a semester or two off. Again check with your registrar. I took a semester off without my loan's interest kicking in or having to re-enroll at JMU. Non-profit organizations are always looking for volunteers. Meetup dot com (sorry dont know the subreddits rule for links) is a great place to find orgs that you can network, volunteer, and practice your skillset or find one if you are willing to explore. Highly recommend, this is also how I found my current job. The risks of returning Your health, obviously, but it is a bit more nuanced than that. You could be lucky and and never catch it. You could be extremely unlucky, catch it, and die. Are those the dice you want to roll? Lets also explore the in-between options. You could be asymptomatic and pass it to no one. You could be asymptomatic and start a whole another cluster by passing it on to other people. You could get sick and recover quickly, or you could be sick and be on a ventilator for 51 days and lord-knows what other complications you could develop down the line (read the NY Times article ""51 days on a ventilator""). I don't know about you but when I went to school the most I had to worry about was catching the common cold. The quality of your education is going to suffer. Stressed and sick professors don't make for good lecturers. Chaos is not a good learning environment. You are spending exorbitant amounts of money (and loans that accrue interest!) to get less in return. My recommendation. The only way I can in good conscious recommend attending JMU this year is if everything is online and virtual. JMU has not announced that it is starting online, while UVA has. This will be the only time I endorse UVA over JMU and urge you to consider a transfer (or to any accredited school that is doing online-only during the pandemic!) or start at a Community College. Absolutely no shame in that. What JMU is doing is appalling and the implication of money > your safety is a terrible precedent to set. Closing I write this because I care. I care about the health of the students, faculty, support staff. I care about the quality of your education. You made me the person I am today and I am pissed that my own (the students,support staff, faculty) are being put in harms way unnecessarily. I care that you are getting unnecessarily fucked by the powers to be just because they said so. I learned from JMU to question authority, even if that authority is JMU. I wrote this because I cannot do nothing in the face of wrong; it would weigh on my conscious if I didn't voice my thoughts/concerns and maybe help someone stay safe. Dukes step-up.

comment,Stay Safe - Don't go back,"None of this is wrong. During a normal year, dorms are still a Petri dish. I had the worst flu of my life when I was a freshman in Hillside and with the way things are going now, there is NO foreseeable way that students on campus could be safe. Not to mention that people WILL party, WILL ignore mask rules, and you’ll be forced to live in the same confined space as them. I think the question for an upperclassmen about what to do is much more difficult, but if you’re an incoming freshman, stay home and take online community college classes. Do not pay 4X to go to a JMU summer camp for two weeks and get sent home to do the same exact thing. You will not get the freshman experience the rest of us got. No Halloween, no football, no going out, none of it.

comment,Stay Safe - Don't go back,I’m a rising junior and transferred from a community college. I’m attending in the fall for in person classes. I don’t think jmu is bad for it. They aren’t forcing anyone to do anything. It’s really just student choice whether to attend or not. I choose to attend. I appreciate the concern; felt like it came with good intentions.

comment,Stay Safe - Don't go back,"Good questions, I am glad you brought them up. Like I said in my post, these are not ideal times, we can only mitigate damage for the most part. If you can take your classes online - highly recommend it. If you have to fall under full-time status, do it, you have 6 months to return to full-time status before your loan payments kick in. Better to be safe than sick. You might have to take may-mester classes to ""catch up"" (catch up to what though, life is a marathon not a sprint). Whether you like it or not - you may be graduating late. This is a no-win scenario. The quality of your education is going to be affected. If you get sick or come in contact with someone who is sick, you are going to quarantine for 2 weeks and be doing classwork online anyway. I can imagine that you will be required to do multiple quarantines if multiple outbreaks occur on campus. If your professor is sick, then what? You're going to be missing instruction. If you are extremely unlucky, you'll be in the hospital where graduating on-time will be the last thing on your mind. Either way, your quality of education this semester is not going to be as good as pre-pandemic. For that reason alone it is worth postponing your plans. Let me tell you a bit about my story and why I am glad I didn't stick to my path and graduate on time. I started out music and realized a year in that I hated it. Switched majors and started from scratch. Started International Relations and hated that too. Then I was diagnosed with Crohn's Disease and was too ill to go to school. During my time off i recovered and found my path (IT/software dev - took a course on a whim at a community college). I am glad I took time off because 1) i could explore my career options freely 2) while I was sick I couldn't learn - I wasn't getting anything out of my education, much like how the quality of your instruction will suffer through the sheer chaos of the times we live in and how unprepared JMU was in response. They had all summer to set up infrastructure and they pissed the opportunity away. 3) I realized graduating on-time and adhering to other people's expectations and time-frames is bullshit and trying to keep up expectations/appearances was exhausting. When I was accepted into the CoB and did COB 300 I met people who were 24, 28, and 32 years old. Some were military, some dropped out earlier and decided they wanted to finish, some just took longer. Mind you Cob300 is just a bit after the halfway point in the school business majors. These people were graduating at 26, 30, 34 years old. All three of those people are doing EXCELLENT in their careers and are extremely mature professionals. It took me 5.5 years to complete and I have no regrets for it. If i stayed the course and graduated on time, I would have finished with a major I hated and I would have despised my entire time here because I was sick and not getting anything out of it. There is no shame in graduating late, pushing to graduate on time for the sake of it is not worth your well-being and health and you won't get as much out of it education-wise. You have your entire life to graduate and do good in this world. How long it took doesn't matter, especially during these strange times. There is no gradution-on-time-police. No one cares how long it took you. Do keep busy - or take the semester off. Believe me with a full time job it is harder to take vacay than I realized. Take advantage of the part-time semester or entire semester off. Finding a volunteer organization you can safely contribute is one route. I volunteered software dev at local non-profits and went to ""code and coffees"" I found at [meetup.com](https://meetup.com) (they have all since become virtual). I ended up meeting someone who hired me at these events. If you have an internship, reach out to the internship host org and let them know you can continue working with the organization if they'd have you. If you free-lance or have a side-gig, I highly recommend engaging in that. I am in no ways suggesting being idle, although that could also be a possibility. if you want to rest, take advantage of it now.",2020-08-06 14:54:29,3

So there were a few times I saw parking services looking at that, seeing the temporary pass, and leaving in defeat.

comment,JMU Eliminates DEI,That’s how I think they’re swinging this. Moving all the money into “totally not DEI related scholarships” and then bringing in the same people they would’ve recruited under DEI initiatives. Instead of publicly defying the government they make all their decisions proprietary and behind closed doors away from the prying eyes of the federal government. “Why’d you select such a diverse range of candidates for these scholarships?” “Oh we just liked them… a lot… just like a lot a lot…” Genius idea considering if the party in power switches Donald’s executive orders are all ripe for repealing and they can just restart their DEI stuff.,2025-04-11 21:03:44,32

comment,anyone know what's happening?,"This announcement just went out from President Alger: Dear JMU Community, It is with a very heavy heart that I write to all of you tonight. We continue to process the loss of one of our students from last week and the tragedy at Bridgewater College. Today, an individual died on our campus and while it is our understanding at this time that they were not a JMU student, faculty or staff member, this has shaken all of us. We offer our deepest condolences to their family and friends. In order to give our community the time and space we need, the university will cancel Assessment Day and no classes will be held on Tuesday, Feb. 8. We will also be providing additional spaces for students to meet with counseling professionals experienced with loss during the times below on Tuesday, Feb. 8. Meeting times and locations for students: • 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Taylor 302 • 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Taylor 303 • 1 p.m. - 3 p.m. in Festival Conference room 7 For additional support please reach out to: • Counseling Center, 540-568-6552 • Dean of Students Office, 540-568-6468 • After-hours mental health emergency support, 540-568-6552, press ""1"" • Sentara RMH Emergency Department, 540-689-1414 • Self-Help resources available through the University Counseling Center • TAO mental health resources • Crisis Text Line – Text HOME to 741741 to reach a crisis counselor • Counseling Center’s Additional 24/7 Emergency Resource Information These difficult moments can often lead to overwhelming feelings and questions. Please know that you are a valued member of the JMU community and we care deeply about each of you. I encourage you to support each other, to check in on your friends and colleagues, and to seek additional support if you feel you may need it.

comment,anyone know what's happening?,"Alum with MDD here. College is hard. You have to work hard, and for what? A number on a piece of paper? Sometimes that number isn't even good. I had like a 2.6, but guess what? Almost everyone I work with and many random people I talk to tell me how clever I am. Nobody brings up their grades in the real world. Turns out it's way more compelling to do the work when you're getting paid to. You are surrounded by so many happy people, but you're not happy. That's not fair! ""Happiest place in earth,"" kinda seems like any other place on earth, but with more drunk college kids. The happiest place on my earth came last year - in the middle of a global pandemic, during a very tumultuous political year, isolated from almost all friends including a former best friend of 10y, in a 875sf apartment I paid way too much for, with a crazy hectic work schedule - when I got my first puppy. This puppy dog fills my heart. If you tough it out, then you can find peace. You can earn your way. It might take some time after you graduate, but once you get your foot in the door the dominoes begin to fall. You can get the experience. It's a lot easier to do some bullshit work when you're getting paid to do it. It's a lot easier to sleep when you're allowed to put your work down and pick it back up on Monday. It's a lot easier to take a deep fucking breath after school. It seems so trite for me to sit here and type out, ""it gets better,"" so I hope giving examples had more impact. I had my suicide planned. I walked by the spot every week. I had the tools in my backpack every day to string myself up. One day in particular the thing that got me out of bed at 3pm was flipping a coin and it landing on that I was going to kill myself. Now, looking back, I'm glad I came to in time. Thank you for reading my novel.",2022-02-08 01:09:24,19
comment,anyone know what's happening?,"I love how the most negative people I have ever met in my life will post one of the generic posts and act like they helped something. Maybe instead of the whole student population sharing the same hotline number, you should take it upon yourself to help others in the jmu community and not be a complete ass. I have been a student at jmu for 4 years now and can count on one hand how many times I've received help from a fellow student. I also was never aware that jmu had any sort of mental health counseling until today. Pretty crazy how it takes two suicides in a week for anyone to acknowledge, or care, that mental heath is a real, very serious issue across any student population. Having lived with mental health issues, I can also say that counciling, hotlines, etc. don't help me, and most likely don't help a lot of others like people expect them to. Please don't act like this is the end all be all. It's incredibly frustrating that people will try to act like they care about the mental health of others during a tragedy like this, but continue to live their self centered, judgemental lives right after posting the story. This problem is far deeper than most people will understand, and the only way anything will ever change is if we stop degrading each other at any chance we get and respect one another.

JMU isn't even good at robbing students, otherwise they'd try to do everything in their power to keep people on campus until Sept. 14th or whenever the withdrawal date is.",2020-08-25 12:14:43,30
comment,you guys fell for JMU's propaganda,"This is completely beside the point but Michael Busing is the dean of COB, he’s not just a regular professor. There’d be riots in the streets if a professor got 200k lol But yeah, the administration just wants your money. While it’s still good to call out other students for being dumb, it was just a hastily planned money grab from JMU and an outbreak was always going to happen, regardless of people partying. Partying just makes it worse",2020-08-25 11:45:07,17
comment,you guys fell for JMU's propaganda,"I agree, but even with this, there’s still definitely a student responsibility to wear your mask and socially distance.

Getting paid more actually puts more pressure on them to sustain the model as is instead of innovating. ...Although siphoning some money to adjuncts working subsistence wages would be good.

Schools are a service. Not a business. When experts in business and business administration run schools, this is what you see. Thank you for your post, OP.

post,Quad Cat Update!,"Quad Cat Update! As some of you have already noticed, two of the Quad’s most iconic residents are missing: Jimmy and Dolley, the Quad Cats, were rehomed earlier this month and will no longer hold court in front of Burruss Hall and Carrier Library. Quad residents since 2010, Jimmy and Dolley have been unofficial main campus mascots and good luck charms. Following a bad leg injury during the summer, Jimmy was evaluated by a local vet who amputated the leg and recommended that Jimmy become an indoor-only cat. After Jimmy had recovered, caretakers picked up Dolley and took her to the vet for a health checkup before reuniting the siblings. At the checkup Dolley tested positive for feline immunodeficiency virus, or FIV, which meant being an indoor-only cat with Jimmy going forward was also in her best interests. Several people on-campus have taken care of the Quad Cats over the years, including CAL’s own Laura Wisman who has been the main coordinator for their care since 2012. Following the vet’s recommendations for both cats, Laura has adopted Jimmy and Dolley. While we will all miss the iconic pair lounging near the fountain and seeking affection from late-night library goers, they are happy and loved in their new home, and we hope they will be for many years to come. Do you have any photos of the Quad Cats? Did you get the chance to pet Jimmy or Dolley after a late night of studying in Carrier Library? Share your memories and photos with us and celebrate the Quad Cat's iconic reign!",2021-09-22 11:00:06,114

People making these accusations need to practice due diligence and provide all of the information before making accusations like this that could potentially ruin someone's life.

But those accusing need to make sure that they have all of their ducks in a row, and present all of their research.

comment,Be aware of this man…multiple people have already seen him this weekend,"> Why are people so ready and eager to throw this random stranger under the bus without first checking the facts? It's really quite disturbing. The court of public opinion is a brutal thing. Unfortunately, too many people are quick to rush to judgment without doing any actual research, and they are also quick to criticize anyone who suggests that they actually do the research to make sure that if they're going to level a heavy accusation like this at someone that it is 100% accurate before firing. It was similarly disturbing when someone posted [to advise people not to support a bar](https://www.removeddit.com/r/jmu/comments/p1wyi6/do_not_support_dukes_the_bar_or_latins_flavor_the/) a few weeks ago because of unfounded accusations against the owner of the bar. It was ridiculous how quick people were to judge without any real proof, and also how, when I [questioned it](https://www.reddit.com/r/jmu/comments/p1wyi6/do_not_support_dukes_the_bar_or_latins_flavor_the/h8k6bcl/), the OP came back with an ad hominem attack based on television-related subreddits that I'm involved in.",2021-08-24 11:59:48,-2
comment,Be aware of this man…multiple people have already seen him this weekend,"He distributed child porn. And he is a tier III offender which is literally the *worst* it can get in VA. Also clearly the state doesn’t think he’s a safe person as his registration was renewed this past June. Do you think we should wait for him to hand us child pornography to make up our minds about him? Why are you bending over backwards to defend a pedophilic sex offender? I interacted with man several times before I knew his history and can confirm that it *is* him. He used to hang around outside my dorm and watch us leave and enter. Edit: Also, the reality is when you do something as evil as what he did, people aren’t going to want to be near you. Ever. You can’t fault anyone for that.",2021-08-24 10:32:58,6

comment,JMU will require students to get the covid vaccine this upcoming academic year,"The devil is in the details. Students do not need to get the vaccine if they fill out the ""Assumption of Risk"" form. Note the wording in the email that says ""Exceptions will be accommodated for medical conditions, religious beliefs **or in cases where individuals agree in writing to the conditions set forth in an assumption-of-risk exemption.**"" It takes the teeth out of vaccination requirements and I would LOVE to see how JMU actually polices the below (they won't). It states: Choosing to forego vaccination puts one at risk for getting the disease with the associated risk of long-term medical problems or death. Individuals who elect not to be vaccinated against COVID-19 may put others they interact with at risk. Due to this risk to others, JMU reserves the right to require those not vaccinated to engage in risk mitigation practices such as wearing masks or other personal protective equipment (PPE), submitting to regular screening tests, and isolating or quarantining off-campus should they develop or be exposed to COVID-19. By choosing not to be vaccinated, people run a greater risk of becoming ill with COVID-19 and will be required to isolate per CDC guidelines if they become infected. Those not vaccinated against COVID-19 and exposed to someone with the disease will be required to quarantine for up to 14 days. AGREEMENT I have read and reviewed the information provided above concerning the risks and benefits of the COVID-19 vaccine. For personal reasons, I have chosen NOT to be vaccinated and therefore I accept the consequences associated with this decision. I acknowledge this by initialing each of the following: ____ I agree to engage in reasonable risk mitigation practices as required by the university, including the use of PPE, entry testing and submission to regular screening tests. ____ I agree to immediately notify the University Health Center if I test positive for COVID-19 or have a known or suspected exposure to someone with the virus. ____ I agree to isolate or quarantine off campus if required by the university or the Virginia Department of Health. ____I understand that, in the occurrence of an outbreak, I may be asked to leave campus for my own protection and the protection of others until the danger has passed. ____ I agree to assume the risk that I may be exposed to, and become sick from, COVID-19 and to hold the university and its employees harmless from the consequence or effects caused by such illness. I have had the opportunity to read this document and ask questions about it. I now voluntarily sign below to demonstrate my understanding of it and commitment to abide by it.",2021-05-27 11:10:12,38

comment,JMU will require students to get the covid vaccine this upcoming academic year,"This to me is the university’s way of saying they aren’t responsible if you choose not to get the vaccine and still come to campus. I will say that if they require students to present proof that they have gotten the vaccine this could be effective in the classroom. Professors could have a list of every unvaccinated student in class and can ensure unvaccinated students are masked while in a more confined space. Unvaccinated students will be subject to screening, so they’re committing to being randomly tested throughout the year. Obviously not giving students that choice to say “mmm no thanks” just because would be the ideal situation. In my opinion that’s what every university should do. However I can also see that universities are in a tough spot due to mistrust of the vaccine and this may be JMU’s way of finding a compromise. Either way it sucks.",2021-05-27 11:56:54,10

comment,JMU will require students to get the covid vaccine this upcoming academic year,"Do you realize how long the FDA usually takes to okay the normal medication? About five years. They fast-tracked this because there was a huge abundance of information about the mRNA vaccine given the huge tests they were doing, and also because of the lethality of the virus. Every one of these vaccines will be okayed by the FDA by the end of the year. You certainly can wait until then as it's your prerogative - but understand that it's emergency use simply because the FDA understands how dangerous this illness is and also because their normal bureaucratic red tape will not allow them to move faster on this.",2021-05-27 19:31:47,8
comment,JMU will require students to get the covid vaccine this upcoming academic year,"Its not about hesitancy, its the fact that employers/schools cant actually require people to get the vaccine because it’s currently under emergency use authorization. Thats why theres an “at-risk exemption” for JMU. Once its fully approved by the fda then they can require the vaccine without exemption just like the measles or chicken pox vaccine. Obviously if you go to jmu, you don’t actually have to get it but im fully vaccinated and feel great. Just food for thought.",2021-05-27 21:48:30,4
comment,JMU will require students to get the covid vaccine this upcoming academic year,"I sort of mirror that point of view. The way I see it, as little as we know about the long-term damage covid might do, we know even less about the long term effects of these vaccines. I'm not concerned about immediate damage or anything (microchips or any other bs) and I don't think there is any malicious intent or conspiracy. In mirroring your view I'm young, healthy, and have none of the COVID risk factors so I'd rather take my chances with COVID and I'd like to be able to make that choice for myself without anyone trying to force my hand. I'm not an antivaxer, my parents are high risk and I supported/bolstered their decision to get the vaccine because for them we see the risk of COVID death/long term damage as high, and also at their age if there a long term negative effects of the vaccine they'll be living with them for 15-20 more years rather than potentially 50-60 years for myself.",2021-05-28 09:19:55,2

comment,JMU will require students to get the covid vaccine this upcoming academic year,"Because you can actually HURT other people by not getting it. If you care about the community, you would care about that. There are immunocompromised people who CAN'T get the vaccine and will be at risk if the rest of us don't get it. That's no different than smallpox or any other virus. I have children who don't have the vaccine yet. I need to continue to wear a mask because on the very slim chance that I got it (being vaccinated) I could give it to my kids. My daughter is immunocompromised and could die from it. Your actions have ripple effects through society.",2021-05-27 19:28:20,7
comment,JMU will require students to get the covid vaccine this upcoming academic year,The only reason I'm planning to get it now is because it's looking like I'm going to have to get vaccinated prior to starting grad school anyway and it's just not worth it to me to spend a semester getting swabbed once a week when I'm going to have to get vaccinated later on. Might as well bite the bullet sooner rather than later.,2021-05-27 21:52:48,1
comment,JMU will require students to get the covid vaccine this upcoming academic year,It is a HIPAA violation when a university health department collects private medical information from a student and then tells people who are not a part of that health apparatus who have and have not received a vaccine. It's not a HIPAA violation for me to simply ask someone if they've been vaccinated. It's a HIPAA violation when a health agency gives that information to a third party. JMU cannot release that information to professors.,2021-05-28 07:40:58,5

post,I actually want to stay online.,"I actually want to stay online. Idk about you guys, but I want to stay online. If we go back in October, I just see us eventually going back online anyway, especially after Halloween and Thanksgiving break. I already thought that jmu would end up ultimately deciding to move classes to online after thanksgiving, but now I’m just hoping we stay online.

comment,JMU COVID Update 8/27: 110 Self-reported cases + 15 positive tests at UHC,"They can’t mandate shit RE: off-campus housing. They have just as much of a right to “mandate” you leave your off-campus dwelling as they have to “mandate” your bed time. Adults are free to live wherever they please. If this happens, I’d expect most students to stay in Harrisonburg. The only ones that won’t are the ones legitimately concerned about getting covid, the ones legitimately concerned about following the “rules,” and the ones with parents that drag their asses home. If they want to stop off-campus partying/gathering, they’re going to have to get the municipality involved. Municipal approval to shut off power/water service to houses repeatedly found in violation of gathering limits is the only way this ever stops, and even then, you’ll probably see at least a few houses dedicated to parties w/ the residents moving elsewhere to have power/water. Edit: I also doubt we’ll see graduate programs go full virtual. Many, many programs have critical in-person components, namely labs.

If you attend school and classes for 3-4 weeks, that's almost 25% of the semester, and even though they pushed the normal date to withdraw to later, the university still should be able to recoup some of the costs for students attending for 4 weeks -- education isn't free in this country. September 15 is the normal day to withdraw, everyone knows that, and has known that, and they pivoted to online classes well before that, which gives students plenty of time to withdraw even with the new date. I with y'all, I don't think the Administration handled the pandemic and return well at all, but unless I'm missing something big besides ""Alger Bad,"" I don't think we should be faulting them for this one . . .",2020-09-03 13:49:02,11

What is going to be different in 4 weeks? We had an entire summer at home and look how quickly it spread when everyone was back. My advice to anyone unsure, especially freshmen, is get your money back and take a do-over next spring or fall. It sucks but if you try to ride out this semester hoping to move back in you are almost definitely losing your chance at any semblance of a real freshman year experience.",2020-09-03 16:35:50,3

post,Copper Beech Abduction 10pm 6/09/2021 (TW),"Copper Beech Abduction 10pm 6/09/2021 (TW) Trigger warning: abduction of a woman by two men Edit 6/10/2021 6:30pm: since this post has gained some traction, I want to take responsibility for easing worries this has caused. I am not redacting anything I have shared as it all holds true for what I witnessed. I simply want to highlight context for people to better understand the situation. First, I did not witness the beginning of the altercation as I had only looked out the window after hearing the woman’s screams for help. Second, I have mentioned both in this thread and in my report to the police that there were subtle cues that the victim may have known the two men and this could have been the result of some dispute (further details in an edit below), so I believe it’s important to state there’s a chance this was not a random targeting. Lastly, the event occurred on the main road that cuts through Copper Beech (Chestnut Ridge Dr.) so I don’t necessarily think it’s fair to discredit Copper’s safety or security especially since I often see police cars patrolling the individual roads multiple times a week, day and night, over the past year I have lived here. I think it was important for me to make people aware of this event and I hope only good things will transpire from this all. Original post: This happened at the intersection of Bayberry Ln and Chestnut Ridge Dr. I heard a woman screaming at the top of her lungs to let go of her and looked out my window to see a man grappling her from behind but they weren’t moving from the spot they stood at. I ran upstairs to the deck to see what I could do and the first man had let go of her and started walking back to a white sedan parked on the side of the road. A second man came out of the car and walked towards the woman who was slowly walking away and at first the man tried to coerce her back to the car before starting to forcibly bring her back to the car. Meanwhile, the other man seemed to walk towards other witnesses in a threatening manner and I began to worry about a gun. I ran back inside and downstairs where I had left my phone and sprinted back upstairs to see them taking off with the woman in the car. It appeared that other witnesses got in their car to follow the sedan. I immediately called the police to report in full detail what I had just seen. I feel guilty that there wasn’t more I could do in the moment as it happened about 100 yards away and I was frozen at times trying to comprehend what was happening. I really don’t know if this has any place being here but this subreddit was my only idea to see if anyone else in copper witnessed this. Edit: updated the use of “girl” to “woman” for clarity. Edit: Above is an unbiased exact description of the event. As for my first hand interpretation, there’s a chance that the woman knew one or both of the men. I base this off of her little (but not absent) physical resistance when being bear-hugged from behind by the first man. After he let her go, I noted that she only slowly walked away with a sense of urgency that did not match her desperate tone of voice. I also mentioned that the second man at first seemed to try and coerce (maybe reason with?) her to get in the car but very quickly turned aggressive, forcing her clearly against her will back to the car. She showed much more resistance this time with the second man as he clearly struggled to pull her towards the car. I stand by justifying this as an abduction as her screams and pleas for them to let her go were full of terrified emotion and gut wrenching. There could be many other reasons for her physical actions not matching her pleas but this is simply my thought. Under no circumstances should she have been forced to stay with those men based on her clear desire to get away from them. Update 11am 06/10/2021: I received a call from the local police sergeant a few minutes ago. He was informed of the situation this morning and wanted to call me to clarify my initial report and get more info. I again provided in extreme detail the situation and appearances of everyone involved. I asked if anyone else had called in and he said no. He had no updates to provide as the purpose of the call was simply to confirm my initial report. He said he may reach out again in the future if needed.",2021-06-09 22:36:43,100

comment,Copper Beech Abduction 10pm 6/09/2021 (TW),The police commented that they've only had one report and are 'aware of the post' (this one)...this whole thing feels like a botched abduction investigation to me and now HBPD is trying to cover its tracks.,2021-06-13 11:11:09,5
comment,Copper Beech Abduction 10pm 6/09/2021 (TW),"I mean all they’ve heard is someone was dragged into a car that drove off. That’s definitely not disorderly conduct, but sounds like an abduction. I suspect copper beech management has something to do with how this is being downplayed, to keep their residents feeling safe. In an abduction the first 48 hours are all that matters, and since the police didn’t treat it like an abduction, but instead a “well-being check,” it makes things so much worse for that girl.",2021-06-10 19:27:57,1

Also, no police report has been filed which is odd, not that this would be a high priority case for them, but a report should still have been filed.

comment,Copper Beech Abduction 10pm 6/09/2021 (TW),"I would suspect management of trying to downplay a kidnapping that happened on their premises, as they not only have huge motive to hide this, but also chose not to inform their residents whatsoever about the situation. If you’re apartment complex becomes infamous as the “abduction” complex, it’s bad for business. I mean if they could technically call an abduction, “disorderly conduct,” why wouldn’t they. With regard to insight into the investigation, you’re right. I have no clue what they are or aren’t doing behind the scenes. That said, if it were being treated like the abduction it was reported as, that Facebook message would’ve came out late last night/early this morning. Also you would have gotten an alert from jmu letting you know. People who live in copper with windows facing the intersection would have been getting questioned this morning. When police are investigating an abduction there are usually some telltale signs of urgency as they know the clock is ticking. They sat on this for a whole day. Plus they still can’t put a face/name out there in hopes she gets recognized. It’s not hard to find WHO is missing, only WHERE she is being held.",2021-06-10 20:06:15,6

I have no doubt that the Provost expressed this to Dean's and faculty in the summer that they needed to have a quick way to turn their classes online. Unlike last semester and spring break, they have had way more time to plan. However I am a realist. I know that some professors are going to be better at it than others.

comment,JMU SGA on Twitter - Formal Request to temporarily halt instruction,"Although this is true, it's important to remember that instructional faculty are on 9 month contracts, meaning that they are not compensated for their time between graduation and the first day of classes. Administrative faculty (for example, an academic unit head) are on 12 month contracts, and are compensated as such. This is often forgotten, and despite spending several weeks of my personal time trying to make sure my classes could convert, I expected to have a few weeks in person so I prepped it (as you suggest I should have, again uncompensated). The pivot came a lot sooner than anyone expected. Week 2 material for a f2f class was assumed to be f2f. So my bad that I tried to prepare ahead of time, since it all has to be redone now. F2f lesson plans do not pivot to online seamlessly. Normally I would have Fridays for research. I spent 7 hours recording content for next week instead. Please don't forget that faculty are people with other responsibilities and commitments too. If we're supposed to be on call 24/7 to be front line with students, convert an in person discussion class meeting at 9am into an online class, with 15 hours warning, or work late into the evening and weekends to redo what we spent weeks of our ""vacation time"" already doing, we're not going to make it very far. I'm already seeing burnout and we're on week 2. But also want to give big thanks to libraries. They've been absolutely amazing and aren't recognized nearly enough.",2020-09-04 21:11:55,12

comment,Moving into the village before they had AC,"The Village is slated for demolition and replacement on the campus master plan, and so for that, window A/C units make sense because they're relatively cheap and easy to implement, and make the buildings more comfortable in the time that they have left. So the Village will never be renovated, and so it doesn't make sense to do massive upgrades to buildings that the university is planning to demolish.

post,President Alger Mishap!,"President Alger Mishap! Guys, it’s Ryan Cerbus. I really need your help now. A few days ago I was at the Harrisonburg downtown festival. It started off as a really fun time! I made so many new friends and made a lot of memories! But, as things usually go life hit me hard. I was walking through a busy crowd and I accidentally stepped on someone’s shoe. I looked up and saw a handsome man with a muscular build and grey hair. Then it hit me. It was president Alger. He grabbed me by the shirt with his muscular forearm. He pinned me to a wall and started screaming at me. I said “Please Mr. Alger it was an accident!” But he was ruthless. He shook me around before throwing me onto the pavement. I watched him walk away from my crumpled body. My vision started to get blurry and I started seeing stars. As he was walking away, he dragged his thumb across his neck. It wasn’t just a threat. It was a promise that his wrath wasn’t over. I’ve been hiding in my apartment for the past three days. Every day is spent in panic. I’m starting to run out of food. What should I do? I see his henchmen at night looking for me. Please help me- Ryan Cerbus",2019-08-27 18:08:11,103

We started trying to climb up when we heard someone shout at us. We immediately thought it was the cops, but dear god it was so much worse. Standing between us and the exit was President Alger. He just stared at us in the darkness for a good 30 seconds, and none of us knew what the fuck to do. Then all of a sudden, the man spreads his arms out in a T-pose, and sprints straight towards us. This had to have been the fastest sprint I’ve ever seen in my life. He ran straight into our group, and with his outstretched arms, clotheslined every single one of us. We all fell to the ground, out cold. We woke up in the morning, barely able to remember what happened. I never knew if I dreamed it or not.

I told him how cool it was to meet him in person, but I didn’t want to be a douche and bother him and ask him for photos or anything. He said, “Oh, like you’re doing now?” I was taken aback, and all I could say was “Huh?” but he kept cutting me off and going “huh? huh? huh?” and closing his hand shut in front of my face. I walked away and continued with my shopping, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When I came to pay for my stuff up front I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen Milky Ways in his hands without paying. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to pay for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the bars and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each bar and put them in a bag and started to say the price, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",2019-08-28 10:43:11,16

Obviously LiveSafe isn't a great system, but purposely ignoring it invites disregarding the validity of other Covid protective measures. Ipso Facto, part of the problem.",2021-02-23 10:08:03,1

comment,PSA TO ALL INCOMING FRESHMAN,"Definitely. It was just luck of the draw, which meant that you didn't have to worry. You just saw where you were assigned, and then planned accordingly. About the only way that you could pick your dorm was if you chose smoke-free, which narrowed you down to Eagle, Weaver, or McGraw-Long, or substance-free, which put you in Shorts. I'm kind of glad that we couldn't pick, because while I chose smoke-free housing (weird to think that smoking was allowed in most dorms until 2001), if I had been able to pick between the smoke-free dorms, I probably would have chosen Eagle because I started out as a business major, and was thinking about proximity to Zane Showker Hall. Also, considering the capacities of the three smoke-free dorms, there was a slightly higher than 50% chance that I would have ended up in Eagle. Ultimately, I ended up in McGraw-Long, which surprised me. But I went in with a good attitude, and in the end, I was glad to have gotten McGraw-Long, because it was an overall better dorm than Eagle, being newer and having slightly bigger rooms, even if it was further away from Zane Showker Hall. But being freshman year, where you have gen-ed classes all over the campus, proximity to Showker didn't matter at all, and McGraw-Long, with its relatively central location, worked out quite well for that.",2022-07-21 14:02:50,2

comment,saw this on twitter and thought it was interesting.,"What we're dealing with now isn't just a drop in enrollment. The deal that was struck by Virginia higher ed institutes with the General Assembly was that they would freeze tuition in exchange for an increase in funding from the GA. However, that extra money isn't likely to be coming because of budget shortfalls in Richmond due to the economic squeeze from COVID-19. So now all of these schools are in a position where they had budgeted expenditures based upon that money that isn't coming. You will be seeing far fewer adjuncts on campus in the fall as a result of all this, relying on full-time faculty to pick up the extra course loads because they don't have to pay them extra to do it. There was a concern that no adjuncts would be getting a contract, but I know there are a few here and there. They wouldn't be able to make it all work, otherwise, but even with that the professors will be stretched very thin.",2020-07-14 06:00:51,14
comment,saw this on twitter and thought it was interesting.,I am gladly taking the semester off. I can’t give them my money for that plan and especially if (more like when) they decide to move back online. Manipulative bs.

post,update on JMU,"update on JMU Heyo, I wanted to make this quick update because I think it’s important for you all to stay in the loop and I want to help clear some stuff before misinformation goes out. Please bear with me as this week is insanely busy (if you have Scherpereel for POSC240 and Teel for GEOG332 pls hmu lol) 1. The proposed capital infrastructure: JMU is going to ask the Virginia General Assembly for a few grants this session; these aren’t loans and these grants won’t affect our tuition. Here are the requests: Carrier: $108,750,000 East Campus Infrastructure-- Phase II: $30,190,000 Johnston Hall: $20,250,000 College of HBS: $79,920,000 They want to expand and renovate Carrier because it’s old. As Mr. Charlie King had explained to me, “the building is so old that they don’t even make the parts that it needs anymore.” The powerplant on East Campus is at a size where it’s too small to function for its demanded energy output. Apparently, it keeps dying and is, “down more than it’s up.” Johnston Hall needs to be updated to include AC and become ADA-compliant. They want to expand the College of HBS because it’s the college with the largest enrollment and they need more space. The way that JMU’s budget works is interesting because there are 2 different types-- the auxiliary and E&G (education and general) budget. E&G is everything that’s related to educational expenses (upkeep of buildings, building educational capital projects, etc.); the auxiliary budget is everything that’s “extracurricular” in college (athletics, dining, counseling services, etc.). The Virginia General Assembly will only cut checks for E&G-related proposals, which is why JMU is asking them for some moola to construct these buildings. Also, they’re proposing to renovate the Village; they’re currently working out the planning process before they get the architects to come in. More details will come out soon. 2. Parking Yes, parking is horrendous. Our University Services chair, Grace Bailey, talked to them and we found out that they sold 1,000 more parking permits than they usually do. They also don’t have a cap on the number of permits that they sell each year. 3. Other things to know AUBC (the Algerdome) is going to be LEED-certified sometime soon. East Campus was supposed to receive a huge solar panel installation this summer but the plans somehow got delayed. JMU is $400M in debt. Aramark’s contract ends sometime in like 2030. The Board of Visitors (the people in charge of President Alger) meeting is this Thursday and Friday; you should be able to watch it on a live stream somewhere; I was told it was going to be on YouTube but don’t quote me on that because I want to double-check this. Environmental Management Club is having a climate strike this Friday and I want you all to be there; my best friend is the President and this is going to be an amazing event!

comment,update on JMU,"A renovation to Carrier Library seems about right. The building was expanded in the 1980s (flat-roofed section) and again in the 1990s (third floor on the flat-roofed section), which puts that building solidly in the ""old"" category, with a lot of the building systems at 30-40 years old. Similarly, the east campus power plant probably does need expansion, considering how much more is over there now. When that was built, there were only a few buildings there, but now it's pretty built up.",2021-09-20 21:17:04,15

comment,update on JMU,East Campus Power Plant was originally built in 82 as a trash combustor. It was added on to in 96 with gas boilers and chillers.

comment,Evening flight over JMU,"Very similar. PPC is a two passenger trike that requires a sport pilots license and FAA registration to fly legally, among other things. Paramotors are single seat ultralight aircraft that fall under FAR part 103. Can’t be over 254 lbs dry weight, no more than 5 gallons of fuel, recreational use only, power off stall speed may not exceed 24 knots of airspeed. PPC flies a little faster, more stable, and not a very good glide ratio. Paramotor is the opposite, relatively slow (unless you have a speed bar) long glide slope, geared more towards acro flying. The guy you are referencing is named Tucker Gott. He is well recognized as one of the most famous paramotor pilots in the nation. Also the 4th man on the planet to perform a power loop. Wing-over into a full power back flip all while under canopy. Open cockpit is one of the truest forms of flight. I put in earbuds, goggles, and just go. Weather is the greatest factor for something as light as what we fly but you can get into either side of the sport for under 10 grand. One of the most enjoyable things you can do with your clothes on",2023-04-14 15:46:40,3

comment,Evening flight over JMU,That's so cool! I remember when I first stumbled across one of his videos a few years ago and thought it looked sick. And then followed up to see training courses down in Florida are about 6k haha. But that's sweet man thanks for the response. When you takeoff in yours do you also need a solid 100 meters of empty space to takeoff and land or since yours is a bit faster do you not need as much space?,2023-04-14 16:25:59,1
comment,Evening flight over JMU,That’s because they are raping people. Sorry but i got sport pilot training for a quarter of that and you don’t need a license for paramotors yet they charge 6k🙄 There are guys that picked up a paramotor and a good wing for about 4 grand and self taught. My brother did that and other than 2 close calls due to sheer self inflicted stupidity he’s been fine ever since. All the Russian cats that fly in this area are self taught and fly in weather they have no business flying in and haven’t died yet. It’s the best training money can buy but 6k is fiscal assault and battery. I can do 100m in perfect conditions but that’s asking for it. I fly from a small private strip west of Harrisonburg that is 1800’ long. Local farmer has a hangar and a few guys fly different planes out of there.,2023-04-14 16:44:24,2

comment,how long are they gonna drag this out,I hate to even bring this possibility up. But I think that they may go the route of suspending in person classes for only a mere two weeks first.

They are doing this because despite all the BS in academia they care about connecting with and educating all of our dumb asses. They also have families to support and bills to pay and can't afford to not show up. You know what happens if they don't show up? They get fired, and because the job market is so horrific, they get easily replaced. Your fight is not with the faculty member making $65k a year and showing up each day to try and do their best, your fight is with the people at the top making $300 - $500k AND making all the decisions at very little personal risk.

If the test result is negative then everyone in that pool is negative and knows in less than 24 hours. If the pooled test is positive then the samples are each ran in their own slot which takes a few more days.,2020-08-22 16:00:14,4

post,Tips for Freshman (Frog Week/Parties),"Tips for Freshman (Frog Week/Parties) * If cops come to a party you're at, drop your drink and walk out with your group. They're not there to bust you, they're gonna deal with/are there for the residents/hosts * Uber/Lyft are expensive as all hell during peak party times, look for sober rides (I'll share the links later) on the various Facebook pages - $5 most of the time, pack people into the car... Just please, please, don't puke in my car * The blue-shirt ""police cadets"" that walk around on campus aren't cops. They're not ""out to get you"" though. They'll call the cops if they think you're doing something illegal, but will hardly talk to you if ever... You *can* run away from them in all honesty. * Your RA is not out to get you. They know that you're probably gonna go out and drink, they just have to make sure you're safe. If you don't want to get in trouble, stay sober enough to make it back to your room. Probably good advice anyway. * If you're having a dorm party, keep the music/noise down and the RA's won't ever question it. * Don't try to smoke in hall style dorms, you'll get caught. Village can be pulled off with a bunch of fans/towels under the doors. * Don't trash the campus because you're drunk and it seems funny. We all go here, we all pay for the maintenance. Don't make it worse. Plus, if you get caught vandalising campus you're gonna be in a lot of trouble. * If you get caught with alcohol on campus (dorm or otherwise) it's really not that big of a deal. I'd bet more than 1/3 of JMU has a strike. You get (at least) 3 strikes before you're suspended. Strikes are given for possession of alcohol or marijuana. In Virginia, your body is considered to be a container, if you've drank alcohol and it's in your body, you're considered to be in possession of it. * If you haven't really drank before, start slow; learn your limits. You're gonna be hungover and it's gonna suck. Drink (at least) one bottle of water/Gatorade before you fall asleep, Tylenol and a shower in the morning, more Gatorade, and brunch if you can stomach it. You'll live. * Fake ID's do not pass at almost any bar in Harrisonburg. They've seen them all before. You're 18, can barely grow a beard, but your brothers ID has a full beard. If you're in a group, not everyone is from Delaware, it's only so big of a state. ABC will not accept your fake, they'll take it and call the cops. Don't risk it, meet someone old enough in one of your classes or find your hallmate/suitemate with an older sibling. * Try to make it to as many of the actual frog week events, you only get to do frog week once. It might seem lame, and you might want to just drink and sleep, but you have (at least) 4 years to do that. Take advantage of the opportunity to meet new people and you won't regret it. You will regret sleeping through all of frog week and missing everything. I met some of my best friends frog week, friends that I'm living with this year, friends that'll be invited to my wedding one day.",2019-08-14 09:25:31,90
comment,Tips for Freshman (Frog Week/Parties),"Would just like to make a suggestion to stick with Ibuprofen INSTEAD OF Tylenol for hangovers. Tylenol, like alcohol, is processed through the liver, and combining the two can, at times, be fatal. You're going to have nights where you drink so much that you're still drunk in the morning. If you pop a Tylenol on those occasions, you're putting yourself at risk. Stick with Ibuprofen and, above all else, hydrate yourself. There are risks with Ibuprofen, as well (it is processed through the kidneys, which comes along with its own set of issues with long-term combination with alcohol), but it's less severe than death (which is on the table when you take Tylenol with alcohol), so that makes it a better choice if you've got to choose.",2019-08-14 14:03:42,26
comment,Tips for Freshman (Frog Week/Parties),"With regards to frog week: You definitely should go out if thats your thing. Those first parties are some of the most memorable and you’ll almost certainly have great time and you’ll meet so many people you’re head will spin. If you don’t have an address or don’t think you can get in anywhere, you’re wrong. Get a group of friends together and head out. Walk around until you find something. It’s frog week so there will be huge groups of people out and about who do actually have somewhere to go. Don’t be afraid to ask. With that being said, if you do your partying right you’re probably not going to want to get out of bed the following morning for breakfast w your frog group. MAKE YOURSELF GET UP. You’ll be hungover and exhausted but if you have a cool floor they’ll get up too and you can all bond together over feeling like shit. I made some of my best friends this year through being miserable through the frog events. They aren’t bad at all and it’s honestly your best way to make some incredible friends who live in your dorm.

This tip can also apply during the school year. You don’t need to go out almost every weekend like I decided to, it’s not very fulfilling in the end. Wanna go to a show at Forbes? Do it. Need to do some work for a class? Go ahead and get it done. Just wanna stay in one night but your friends wanna go out? Stay in, and remember, don’t let your friends pressure you do something or go somewhere you don’t want to.

comment,Tips for Freshman (Frog Week/Parties),"Graduated RA here (was RA for two yesrs in the village): I always followed a rule: If you're gonna be stupid, be smart about it. In other words, if you wanna party in your dorm, don't blast music, yell at your friends for another drink, be really obnoxious. That will alert any RA immediately. Especially on the weekends/during frog week. Either keep it chill and lowkey, or party somewhere else. And please, please, *please* do not be a douche. RAs are not out to get you. The last thing they want to do is do their job. They don't want to get you in trouble! They aren't on the prowl to fuck you over. (Unless they're just shitty people in general, but that's not very often from what I know.) They are there to keep you safe and make sure you don't fucking kill yourself. Accept their help if they offer it. Work with them. If you get busted, be courteous and do everything they ask, because they will have to write it all up, but they will also add in that you we nice and apologetic and did everything without arguing. Being nice can work in your favor. Or, they can call the cops. Your choice. And yeah, we can smell when you smoke weed and vape. I once walked into a hall, and it was like walking into a fucking cloud. And fabreeze/air fresheners/dryer sheets don't do anything but make the hall smell like floral weed.

comment,Tips for Freshman (Frog Week/Parties),"I've served on enough OSARP boards to confirm most of this. Just about every time an RA/HD comes before the board, they were just doing their rounds and someone was being stupid about things. The only time I've seen an RA/HD in the room that didn't seem like they'd rather be anywhere else was when the resident had been an ass to them in the process. Another big thing I want to add is that one of the most common issues I have seen is that halls/suites become these open communities where people walk between rooms a lot or maybe a resident has a friend that brings stuff into their room. What is in your room is your responsibility according to JMU policies. So if someone leaves behind anything in your room and it is discovered, you will end up with a strike.",2019-08-15 07:36:39,2

comment,Tips for Freshman (Frog Week/Parties),"Ohhhhh yeah, that is a big one. I actually had to deal with an issue relating to that. I was on a duty tour one night, had just passed a group of residents in my section as they were just coming into the hall. Not even 3 minutes later, I was walking past a room and the door was open, and I saw soooo many empty cans of natty and bud light. The thing is, none of the guys in the room had drank any of it, and none of them actually lived in that specific dorm! It was the biggest clusterfuck ever. The cans belonged to the residents, the guys in there were not the residents, residents were no where to be found because they were all out at frat/sports/class stuff.",2019-08-15 07:53:14,1

comment,NCAA College Football 25 - JMU Sneak Peak,"Just a heads up, I am not a JMU fan, sadly, I never even https://preview.redd.it/hehe1ih6zwxd1.png?width=2790&format=png&auto=webp&s=4a3f8c36bd1a36b34ed59aaf0262ccda452d5831 heard of them until CFB 2025 came out and I used a nice creative team for my local university who is DIV-I but we are relatively new and “small” compared with older clubs (plus the schools Dean / Board) wouldn’t approve of us getting a FB team started because of the cost of a stadium and scholarships etc. Maybe because a majority of our alumni “boosters” are avg 40+ years old 😅. So I am sure you JMU alumni and fans will appreciate this, when I found my school all ready to be downloaded on CFB 2025 XB-SX I guess whomever created FGCU Eagles didn’t take any school out that I know of I just know I changed out JMU and replaced it with FGCU, I have taken the team from 1-1/2\*s to 4 stars in my current 4th year and we are getting ready to play in our 3rd NCG today, where for the first time so far my Eagles are undefeated and are ranked #1! I played all the BIG BOYS this season, barely scraping by (I usually play Heisman, but I knew if I wanted to beat the best, so to hopefully BE the best, I had to lower to All-American, join Big 12 to finally start the CFP ranked 1 instead of 10-12 (Sunbelt as we all know have AWESOME baseball, volleyball, tennis etc. but football falls behind at least in our local paper). So I I played #7 Colorado Univ TWICE (once for BIG-12 Championship, then as fate would have it, my first game of CFP’s QF, I thoroughly enjoyed stomping them out thinking “did I screw up going down a rank?”, turns out that answer was NO! My next opponent in the Semi’s, #2 The U of M was my opponent and they were winning with 8 mins left on the board 3-0! If it wasn’t for a weird (but gladly accepted) back to back interceptions (CPU caught BTW), I was able to run the rock down their throats for a couple of drives. Anyway the scored a couple of back to back TD’s, now they are up 17-14 at the start of the 4th QTR (I don’t play accelerated clocks and I play 15 min qtrs). To end this part quick I was able to keep the rock on the ground for the remainder of the 4th, kicked a FG, INT ball again for a running score and with just under a minute left I got the run play of my life and scored ANOTHER running TD to beat the Canes 37-17! After that game this morning, I decided to take a break because the NCG is against ANOTHER top team in the ACC (Miami #2, Louisville was #3 who just happened to get shanked by their ACC rival #10 FSU! 🤦🏼‍♂️What kind of sick luck puts you on a path to play 3 of the top teams in the ACC (all against themselves except they have to play me!)? I am taking a few hour break from that madness, until later today to bring home the NCG trophy! So I know this is a looong story but it really just helps me show you how I’ve taken care of your Alma Mater and made it into a POWERHOUSE (though even though I’ve just made it to 4*s, my plan is to get them to 5 stars, recruit (hopefully) a 5* QB to start and a WR, then a CB, then I will move the team to BIG 10, then ACC, then SEC where I will finish with a NC while on top of the SE-Friggin-C! Last thing I promise. I didn’t know who JMU’s rivals are, so I finally looked them up today and I have great news for you. So when I brought my sons school to life in the game (FSW Buccaneers), I just haphazardly picked a team to replace them with and the team I chose was Liberty University! FSW has a good baseball team, but alas no football team so as a sign of respect for all of you JMU fans, I will from here on out make them my rival school in the game (which from what I read about JMU this morning, Liberty is kind of a rival to JMU (not like Old D or something close like that), but at least it’s a rivalry, so I will beat the crap out of it and drag the team to every conference I go to 😆.

post,Practical Things To Do,"Practical Things To Do Hi guys/girls, We're all hurt, confused, angry, upset, and this just really is , I hate it. I just wanted to drop 2 things below that I think can be massively helpful. 1 - Just be kind to strangers. You never know when someone's at their breaking point. Flipside, saying something nice can absolutely make their day. No matter the person or situation. You never know how much someone might need it. 2 - Reach out to your friends - like actually text them first and check in. If you just give your phone number, the intention is good but people don't want to be perceived as a bother. Keyword perceived! Just take the 2 seconds to text first! :) I think if these higher ups or Tim Miller or wherever won't put the focus on mental health and make it a forefront, then we'll do it tenfold.

During the past 8 years NDSU has had the better basketball record.

In the MWC 3 schools have reported a negative profit. If you’re gonna make that argument at least have some facts to back it up,2022-01-23 18:52:51,2

comment,Classes haven’t even started and it’s already a mess,"I know you’re referring to tuition, but housing contracts play a bigger role than you might think too. $5k/yr for the 6000+ students on campus every year brings in $30,000,000+/yr. On campus housing rates match pretty well what the university’s cost is for financing those very living spaces. JMU has almost $500 Million in debt from capital projects, many of which are dorms, dining halls, and other newer buildings. Not to mention the new convo (not sure if the convo is in that $500M number). Cancelling housing contracts alone means the university has to come up with that extra $30M in operating costs (meaning this is where the layoffs start happening. Can’t default on loans). And before anyone says athletics, ticket sales at JMU only account for about $3M. Think about that. Housing brings in 10 times the amount of ticket sales for all athletic events in any given year (besides 2020). I’m not defending the university for starting in person. I think starting online would have been the right move for safety, but even if enrollment stays the same that is at minimum a $30M problem to solve. Some of the financial figures: http://apa.virginia.gov/reports/JamesMadisonUniversityNCAA2019.pdf https://www.fitchratings.com/research/us-public-finance/fitch-affirms-aa-idr-for-james-madison-university-va-outlook-stable-27-05-2020",2020-08-26 00:59:46,2
comment,Classes haven’t even started and it’s already a mess,"This issue isn't unique to JMU, but every business has a responsibility to never overburden themselves financially to not be able to weather a down turn in revenue. With $500 million in debt, due to stated projects, JMU is unable to manage even a single semester of drop in revenue? That is poor management. As a result of poor management, the institution is forced to put students and the Harrisonburg community at a higher risk than it would be otherwise. Again, this scenario is an issue across the country, world even; and it's disheartening to know the ones that will suffer are the folks at the bottom.",2020-08-26 01:33:25,2

Of course, I fabricated the story for my own enjoyment. Yesterday, after one of my classes, I decided to relieve my bowels in the bathrooms of Showker. I finished my business and reached for the toilet paper only to realize it was all gone. I wasn’t even able to spin the thing to get another roll. All three toilet paper rolls were empty. I looked under the stalls to check if anyone was in the bathroom (twas empty, to my relief), then waddled over to the next stall with my bare asscheeks hanging out. Thankfully the next stall was supplied with TP and I was able to carry on with my day. That’s the last time I ever lie on reddit.",2020-01-28 18:27:18,85

post,"YSK AVA Care in Harrisonburg is a crisis pregnancy center (aka fake reproductive health centers). There are other, judgement free options available.","YSK AVA Care in Harrisonburg is a crisis pregnancy center (aka fake reproductive health centers). There are other, judgement free options available. AVA Care acts as a crisis pregnancy center in Harrisonburg but their primary mission is to convince people to not have abortions. CPC’s commonly use false medical claims to bolster their misleading arguments. Virginia CPC’s have made outrageously false claims like “condoms are naturally porous and do not protect against STI’s”, “women who have taken the birth control pill for four years prior to their first pregnancy have a 46% increased risk of breast cancer” or “if you have an abortion, you will see that child’s soul again in the future.” AVA Care’s mission is actively harmful to reproductive and mental health. In spite of those dangers, JMU has included them as a vendor for their Wellness Fair on October 5th. JMU’s tacit endorsement of this fake health center poses a danger to the JMU community. If you need access to judgement free reproductive healthcare, visit the [New River Abortion Fund](http://newriverabortionfund.org).

post,The Athletics Portion of Our Comprehensive Fee is the Only Thing Keeping the Athletics Program Alive,"The Athletics Portion of Our Comprehensive Fee is the Only Thing Keeping the Athletics Program Alive This is a bit of a messy topic, but I wanted to know the general consensus around this and at the very least, raise some awareness about this. [2019 Athletics Financial Report](http://www.apa.virginia.gov/reports/JamesMadisonUniversityNCAA2019.pdf) | [2020 - 2021 Comprehensive Fee Breakdown](https://www.jmu.edu/ubo/rates-breakdown.shtml) In 2019, the JMU athletics program was able to generate $11,127,938 in operating revenues. The five largest revenue producers were: 1. Contributions - $3,102,975 2. Ticket Sales - $2,992,676 3. NCAA distributions - $1,671,937 4. Royalties/licensing/ads/sponsors - $1,027,268 5. Other revenue - $819,984 On the opposite side of the coin, in 2019, the JMU athletics program incurred $52,704,654 in operating expenses. The five largest costs were: 1. Athletic student aid - $9,321,388 2. Staff/administration - $8,468,210 3. Athletic facility debt service - $6,543,220 4. Coaching salaries/bonuses - $6,497,229 5. Overhead and admin expenses - $5,340,529 This incurs a **debt of $41,576,716** for the 2019 fiscal year. You might be asking yourself how the school could possibly afford to continue running athletic programs if they're hemorrhaging tens of millions of dollars a year. The answer? Your wallet. **In 2019, JMU student fees accounted for $41,576,716, or 78.8% of our athletics program's operating revenue.** The JMU Schedule of Revenues and Expenses allocates student fees to cover **ANY athletic operating deficit.** I guess it's worth mentioning that if revenues ever exceed expenses, fees are reduced and excess is given to the school's general auxiliary reserve. So if our athletic program ever turns a profit, we get the privilege of paying less and the leftover goes straight to the school's piggy bank. What does this mean for you however? Almost half of your comprehensive fee this year is paying for a program that would bankrupt the school if you didn't pay $2,159 a year. A couple takeaways from me: 1. I don't blame student athletes for this. I believe that offering scholarships for outstanding performance, in any area is a great way to promote higher education while simultaneously allowing students to follow their dreams. 2. I think it's incredibly scummy for the school to list our fees as an operating revenue, when in actuality it's only purpose is to cover the insane debt this produces. 3. [When 37% of our undergrads take on an average of $6,120 in loans to pay for an education here](https://www.collegefactual.com/colleges/james-madison-university/paying-for-college/student-loan-debt/#:~:text=The%20Average%20Loan%20Amount%20for,education%2C%20averaging%20%246%2C210%20per%20year), it's absurd to me that a third of the loans they're taking on just goes to cover more debt.",2021-02-03 12:16:50,85
comment,The Athletics Portion of Our Comprehensive Fee is the Only Thing Keeping the Athletics Program Alive,I am of the belief that we should not be paying for athletics that students A. Can't normally participate in and B. Students can't attend the sport events,2021-02-03 12:58:09,43
comment,The Athletics Portion of Our Comprehensive Fee is the Only Thing Keeping the Athletics Program Alive,"Here's my take. We (JMU) are an institution of higher learning. We're not a gym. We're not a sports club. The vast majority of my academic fees should be going to faculty and staff. It's literally in the name. I have a problem being told that I have to cover debt for a sports program that's hemorrhaging money, just as I had a problem being told that part of the room/board money I was due was going to instead be used to cover debt for the construction on D-Hall and Jennings. That's gross mismanagement on the part of JMU's finance team and it's not my fault that they messed up. Same deal. It's not my fault that the athletics team doesn't know how to manage money, so I shouldn't have to cover their butts. JMU, and a bunch of other schools, keep saying football is going to make them money. It sounds to me like they stand to gain a lot more money if college conferences were to start operating teams out of local gyms or sports clubs. Not just football, either -- basketball, volleyball, baseball, the whole gamut. I'm so sick of higher education institutions being made into sports clubs. That's not what we are, and I hate that it's gotten to a point where a school gets the spotlight through the sports teams and is so adamant about their sports that they decide it's okay to make students cover the money they lose. If I have to take out a bunch of student loans, I'd rather be paying for a beloved professor's retirement pension. We need to put the focus back on education, and research, and opportunities for both students and faculty. That's the whole point of higher education, and that's what we need to get back to. (I apologize for the rant, everyone. I've felt a lot a ways about the emphasis higher ed institutions put on college sports for years.)",2021-02-03 14:27:08,30
comment,The Athletics Portion of Our Comprehensive Fee is the Only Thing Keeping the Athletics Program Alive,"So, interestingly enough, There was a law passed back in 2015 that will force JMU to reduce the funding of athletics from student fees, though only down to 70%. [https://www.pilotonline.com/sports/article\_337e7bec-d46e-5e15-bba6-6fc8de3a5f01.html](https://www.pilotonline.com/sports/article_337e7bec-d46e-5e15-bba6-6fc8de3a5f01.html) This goal is supposed to be met by July 1 of this year. I'm unsure of any developments on this since then, or if there will be grace given because of COVID, but this issue definitely is not a new one. JLARC did a study on student fees and we got legislation out of it. How much that legislation will do is up for debate. In case anyone is interested in the report: [http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt461.pdf](http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/reports/Rpt461.pdf)",2021-02-03 14:24:54,15

Advertising for a school - Even if JMU athletics were enough to sway someone in the college decision process to come here I'd argue that that is irrelevant. I'd so much rather have our school become known for academics and research prestige than our football teams. 2. Producing professionals - JMU has a list of all our athletes that have gone pro [here](https://jmusports.com/sports/2020/6/29/dukes-in-the-pros.aspx). Just quickly counting I see less than 50 names there mostly across 7 major sports, with one athlete in two others. ""Paying them back tenfold"" - Considering the school is investing $52,000,000 in our athletes, if it actually paid us back by any considerable margin, this post probably wouldn't have to exist. 3. Significant loss of spirit - This is a fair claim and I never called for the abolition of college sports. If ""spirit"" is costing me $2,000 every year on top of paying tuition and all other fees - call me spiritless. 4.

comment,The Athletics Portion of Our Comprehensive Fee is the Only Thing Keeping the Athletics Program Alive,">1. Advertising for a school - Even if JMU athletics were enough to sway someone in the college decision process to come here I'd argue that that is irrelevant. I'd so much rather have our school become known for academics and research prestige than our football teams. I'd argue that athletics have the *potential* to significantly improve academics and research prestige at schools, since we've seen it happen at other places and arguably, at JMU. Obviously it depends on how those funds are ultimately distributed but take for instance, to use a local example. Tech was a marginal school academically until their football team gave them a national profile, and now they are considered a national destination as a research school. >2. Producing professionals - JMU has a list of all our athletes that have gone pro here. Just quickly counting I see less than 50 names there mostly across 7 major sports, with one athlete in two others. ""Paying them back tenfold"" - Considering the school is investing $52,000,000 in our athletes, if it actually paid us back by any considerable margin, this post probably wouldn't have to exist. I don't think relying on donations from professional athletes is a very convincing argument given how few JMU athletes go pro, although I also don't think it can be ignored that JMU affords some student athletes academic opportunities that might not otherwise have been available to them if not for sports. >3. Significant loss of spirit - This is a fair claim and I never called for the abolition of college sports. If ""spirit"" is costing me $2,000 every year on top of paying tuition and all other fees - call me spiritless. I'm with you here. ""Spirit"" is worth something but I'm not sure it's worth what students have to pay in athletic fees. >4. ""Spend money to make money"" - Check this post out to know how much money we're ""making"" The vast majority of athletic departments don't make a profit so this doesn't seem like a great argument. Having said all that I know that many students, on this sub in particular, have a hate boner for athletics so it always seems to be a bit of a loaded discussion on this topic, although when I think more about it athletics fees seem more to be more of a symptom of the larger racket that is higher education to begin with. I think athletics is often a convenient scapegoat because it frankly is weird that so much money at schools is used on sports and most students aren't also athletes, but it's part of a larger problem associated with the cost of college in general. I think most students would prefer not to think about that though and I can't blame them Edit: TL;DR I think there's some value to athletics, albeit significant problems which could also be attributed to higher ed in general",2021-02-04 11:07:07,2

comment,"Frat house throwing up nazi salutes, using hate speech, etc?","Cognitive dissonance at its finest. All the signs are right in front of you and yet the mental gymnastics is in full swing to justify what we’re all seeing in real time. As a basic econ lesson: Migrating immigrants to bring up the supply of labor, is simply to lower the demand of many specialized skills and the cost of paying for said labor. Economically suppressing immigrants ability to mobilize is quite in the same vain with these disgusting nazis. They move here, but still live as second class citizens. There is nothing altruistic about bringing in immigrants to short the cost of labor, and pay said immigrants a fraction of the price for work Americans have been doing for decades. You are actively being screwed over by your own faction, and can’t even admit it.",2025-03-17 11:32:15,3
comment,"Frat house throwing up nazi salutes, using hate speech, etc?","i'm confused. you just made a lot of anti-immigration arguments. so you're arguing against immigration? but also saying that to be against immigration is akin to ""disgusting"" naziism? what? also, i don't need an econ lesson. i have a business degree and i am already aware of the points you made... they are a large part of the reason why i don't support third world immigration. how am i being screwed over by my own faction? how do you know what faction i belong to? my faction is against ALL immigration. you don't need to convince me lol",2025-03-17 12:38:37,0
comment,"Frat house throwing up nazi salutes, using hate speech, etc?","Your ideology is based on pushing an agenda so I can understand why you’re confused. There is nothing anti-immigration about wanting immigrants to have the equitable opportunities for economic mobilization as Americans. Permanently stagnated opportunities for income growth in a sector and then bringing in immigrants to do those jobs is NOT advantageous to them. The immigration system needs so much work, in order to make it more efficient and more accessible for people to actually get visas and green cards into the United States. Rather than investing in THAT the current administration is promoting a program that simply drives down the cost of labor in the tech industry specifically…. This is obviously a strategy being used to benefit a very specific type of American. Who was also just throwing up nazi salutes on a very public stage, but I guess that was just a sneeze or whatever to you weirdos who see what you want to see. Like I said: cognitive dissonance.",2025-03-17 12:53:55,2
comment,"Frat house throwing up nazi salutes, using hate speech, etc?","Don't all ideologies aim to push an agenda...? Still, I think I understand now. You think I oppose illegal immigration but support H1Bs. You think I support what Elon is up to. This is where you are wrong: I do not support H1Bs, and I do not like Elon. Though I never said anything that suggested my position on this at all, so I don't know why you wasted so much time trying to convince me out of a belief I didn't hold in the first place? That said, Elon is obviously not a Nazi, nor do his politics lie anywhere close to the NSDAP. I don't know if he was actually doing a Roman salute or not (I'm personally leaning towards no), but even if he was I'm sure he had some strange, autistic reason to do so. What I know for sure is that Elon is 100% a normie, boomer conservative. He vehemently opposes Nazis. His beliefs are in complete contradiction to those of Nazis. Calling people Nazis when there is nothing but a small amount of subjective evidence that points in that direction, and so much evidence that suggests otherwise, is extremely ignorant, and totally diminishes the gravity of such an accusation. And the funny thing is, you have something in common with him: Elon calls people Nazis (/neg) when they disagree with him, too! You and I oppose flooding the job market with third worlders for partially the same reason, except I solely care about how it affects American workers, and you care more about how it affects migrants (whose interests are obviously in conflict with ours; you cannot support both sides). Elon supports legal immigration because he cares more about the interests of BigTech than he does American workers. Trump is a politician and must cater to several conflicting interest groups, often riding the fence, and always trying to appear somewhat moderate. Personally, I don't care what's advantageous or harmful to working class migrants OR highly skilled migrants. I only care what's advantageous to the American working class. Likewise, I don't care what is advantageous or harmful to American corporations– because they tend to prey on the American working class, which is my primary interest group. I don't know if you decided your interest group was immigrants>Americans on purpose because you yourself are not a heritage American, but if this is not the case I strongly suggest you make a clear decision about who you are fighting for. Lastly, I want to say that although I don't share the MAGA position of the anti-illegal immigration pro-legal immigration duality, I think it's obvious that they did not align themselves with those beliefs for the sake of American corporations the way Elon (or perhaps even Trump) has. They identify that way because they care about law and order, so the illegal vs. legal distinction is a big deal to them. It is disrespectful to cross our border without permission, and it's dangerous for the United States to have such weak border security that they have been able to do so in the numbers they have. Conversely, they don't oppose legal immigration, because they see value in immigration for diplomatic and economic reasons, so long that the United States maintains strict control over who is coming in: the process should be long, difficult, restrictive, and each individual should be thoroughly vetted. So, they like H1Bs because it appears to promise to bring in only the most talented people, and they believe this to be a small pool of individuals who are of good character. It makes sense from a shallow perspective, and most people don't care about politics enough to really think about the nuances or shortcomings of such a system. There is no cognitive dissonance, they just care more about the big picture and their priorities do not lie with specific interest groups (still, I find this to be a flaw).",2025-03-17 15:42:53,-2

post,PSA: don't live in the Mill,"PSA: don't live in the Mill The mill has become exceptionally worse as time has gone on. I have lived there for 3 years and I'm so glad I'm escaping this year. I personally had enough from their constant attempts to scam their residents, but now I found out that they are having people write fake reviews and now boast that they are the ""highest rated off-campus community at JMU"" and it's frankly disgusting. This now warrants a warning to anyone else who might fall for it. Mold, leaks, generally falling apart Scams they have tried on me: Cashing my rent check late, then charging me a $75 late fee without telling me, then considering that fee an ""unresolved balance"", therefore charging an extra late fee at the end of the next month. Luckily I was able to prove that I sent the rent on time, or I would have been charged $300 over 4 months. They also tried to claim that one of our chairs that was damaged by a cat was our fault, even though there has never been a cat in our apartment. They knew that this was the case as well, because my roommate's form at the beginning listing damages said ""damaged chair"". They still tried to fight it though, claiming that ""damaged chair wasn't specific enough and therefore we still *may* be charged. They kept it vague because they didn't want us to fight it too hard. I knew that I had listed more specifics on my own form, so we made them find mine. My wording was better, so they at least couldn't take advantage of us this time. There was also a failure to inform anyone on changes to guest parking policy. My girlfriend had been parking there on a semi-regular basis, and at the time the rule was that you had to have a piece of paper listing name, date, guest of apt #, and time parked. One day she randomly got towed, and we had no idea why because she had a pass. It turns out the Mill had changed her parking pass policy and now you had to have a *printed* pass with all the same info on it. The Mill claimed they had a towing grace period, but during this time they didn't inform anyone that their policy had changed and that they would have been towed. It's almost like they wanted people to be towed 🤔 After finding out that I'd be signing an as-is agreement, it seemed as though broken furniture magically appeared in my apartment, including a box frame that had boards snapped in half all down the middle and a desk with nails sticking out. I never could get them to replace the bed all year, and it sank 6 inches down in the middle every time I laid in it. I'm still scared that they are going to ""lose"" my damages sheet and try and charge me. Tl;Dr they absolutely try to prey on college students who don't have other options, and have tried to scam their residents left and right. DO NOT live here, and warn your friends.",2021-06-21 23:53:22,85
comment,PSA: don't live in the Mill,"Agreed.. I won't miss this place and am so sorry you've dealt with so much. Can we talk about the fact that they are requiring residents to get their apartments carpet professionally cleaned before move out this year? (Please don't tell me it's just us..) Apparently it's new, they used to do it between residents but decided to dump that cost on us and require a receipt for proof. How nice. EDIT: I ended up contacting the office and they let me know that the carpet cleaning is not mandatory. They emailed us move-out checklist documents that were for a different property but didn't bother to let anyone know. In case anyone was wondering!",2021-06-22 03:45:18,16

comment,Virginia just decriminalized marijuana,"I'm telling you the reality of the situation is that there are LEO's and prosecutors out there that will 100% charge you with intent even if there is none. I know this from personal experience. This isn't legalization. North Carolina has had decriminalization for decades but people still get busted all the time for intent and possession of paraphernalia. The bill does not change how we address distribution laws and it is up to prosecutorial discretion. What's written into law is different from what people will experience on the ground. Prosecutors and Sheriff's across the state will need to instruct their officers on how to approach marijuana arrests and that's going to vary widely. Until distribution is decriminalized/legalized, people could still be put into legal jeopardy. All I'm saying is to not throw caution to the wind. This isn't legalization.",2020-04-14 13:56:28,2
comment,Virginia just decriminalized marijuana,"Even once it’s legalized fully, people that are distributing will be going to prison. It won’t be made legal just like selling homemade alcohol isn’t legal now. I understand your point but coming from someone that works with these groups, law makers and etc that your situation is the absolute worst case scenario and will not be the norm here in Virginia. Unless you are literally caught selling or having a scale... the state can no longer prosecute you AT ALL. Just like they can’t arrest you for a parking ticket now. Also, Virginia’s decrim and North Carolina’s are a worlds different. Virginia’s decrim is a $25 ticket for all offenses and includes any and all types of cannabis (bud, oil, edibles, etc). You pay the $25 fine and the record is sealed in your civil records. North Carolina on the other hand only decriminalized the first offense, any other offenses you get a misdemeanor, and only includes bud and does not seal the fine from your records. In North Carolina edibles and oil are also felonies and not a part of the decrim.",2020-04-14 14:06:09,1

post,The faculty aren't happy either,"The faculty aren't happy either Students aren't the only ones upset about the way JMU has been handling the coronavirus pandemic. Faculty don't want to be forced into classrooms, risking their health and lives. We have had to fill out lengthy paperwork to ""justify"" teaching specific courses online, while the university has not felt the need to justify forcing faculty to work in unsafe conditions, has no comprehensive testing strategy, and has ""safety"" protocols that amount to little more than hoping people will do the right things. JMU should go 100% online for the 2020-21 academic year, and tuition and fees should be adjusted accordingly. But the unfortunate truth is that tuition and fees cannot be adjusted down without getting rid of a large fraction of the faculty. Adjunct faculty, who make no more than a Walmart cashier, with no benefits, have been cut by 25% or more already, because with no contract and no labor protections, they can be. Faculty near retirement age have been bought out, with no replacements. Yes, administrators' inflated salaries and the bloat of admin positions, with senior VPs sprouting like mushrooms, are a problem. Yes, continually rising tuition and fees are a problem. Yes, faculty salaries, which often remain frozen for years at a time and are still way below the state-mandated level, are a problem. But these problems are not caused by the ""greed"" of the university. They are caused by structural issues at the state level. If you care about them and want JMU to survive and thrive, you should lobby your state representatives to: 1. increase funding for higher education on a per-student basis 2. change the makeup of the Board of Visitors to one that primarily includes education experts, students, and former students, not business people who are cozy with the governor 3. allow faculty and staff to unionize And while you're at it, you can lobby your parents to stop opposing tax increases for education. When taxes go down, your tuition goes up and our salaries don't. Organize, write your reps, get yourselves to Richmond for the next Lobby Day on Jan. 20. The state needs to fund state schools and stop shifting the burden to families and students, pay the teachers and scholars who make JMU what it is a salary commensurate with their expertise, pay adjunct faculty more, rely on them less by expanding full-time faculty, and pay the staff who keep the place running a living wage rather than the poverty wages they are paid right now. We're all in this together. We on the faculty are on your side and want you succeed and be healthy. We want the cost burden of higher ed to be where it belongs, on the commonwealth as a whole, and not on you and your families.",2020-07-14 13:37:27,85

comment,The faculty aren't happy either,"I don't think anyone faults the faculty. I don't think anyone would disagree that faculty deserve more. In my experience, JMU faculty are wonderful and caring. It may be the difference of a ""teaching"" vs ""research"" school. JMU is a teaching school. Having been to both, I'd have to say my JMU experience was excellent. The professors were attentive and seemed to actually care about you and your future, at least in GS. That being said, welcome to the politics of academia. It's mostly thankless and rife with corruption and nepotism....just like every other aspect of life. I personally didn't like academia so I went into... government. Don't I look foolish now",2020-07-14 18:27:39,13

post,JMU is spending less than $20 a student on safety for the fall.,"JMU is spending less than $20 a student on safety for the fall. The headline here should have been ""Charlie King says JMU is spending less than $20 per student on safety in advance of COVID-19"". Seriously, claiming $400,000 is ""herculean"" for 20,000 students and all the faculty and staff is ridiculous. Give me a break. That is nothing at all. That's 20 students worth of tuition/fees. 20. Out of 20,000. The annual budget is somewhere around $600,000,000. This is 1/15th of 1 percent of the budget. 0.067% of the budget is being spent on keeping students, faculty, and staff safe. Meanwhile 40% of the budget is going to dining, parking, and athletics. Do the math The Breeze. Other schools, like VT, are instituting vast testing programs with carefully thought out fall plans. And every other school in the country will end at Thanksgiving break so people aren't going home, getting infected, and coming back for two weeks that aren't really necessary and can be done online.

comment,JMU is spending less than $20 a student on safety for the fall.,"Unfortunately I am not naive, just even more cynical than you think. The university has a lot at stake in being on campus in the fall and those pressures have in no way been alleviated by the state legislature. While I think there is a chance the situation in Virginia will be so bad by September that school will be moved online, I think the more likely scenario is we all come back onto campus and then 3-4 weeks into school have a massive local COVID-19 outbreak hospitalizing many faculty and staff, and some students. Then the university will shut everything down and send everyone home thus sending COVID-19 back into other parts of Virginia. Also, in response to some of the comments about administrators above, they really aren't being greedy. Honestly, they aren't. Their job is to steer and protect the institution and COVID-19 is an existential threat to any college or university right now. Many colleges and universities are going to close their doors for good over the next year or two as a result of this pandemic. I don't personally believe the choice to open up for the fall is at all wise or balancing student/faculty/staff health with institutional needs, but I do know that they are doing it because they believe it's best for JMU, not because they believe it will line their pockets.",2020-07-14 10:01:55,5

comment,let’s gooooo,"Congrats on getting into SMAD! I just graduated with a journalism degree from there in December 2018. I'm a passionate person, so let this be the gospel everybody should know if they're going into SMAD. I'll help with some mistakes/ lessons learned in the program that nobody told me. I feel like I need to pass this stuff on to help a fellow Smaddie! It's a brotherhood, a community, an awesome place to be. Loved every day I came to class. Never a dull day! Cried on my last day. Getting choked up just thinking about it. There's different specialties in SMAD; Journalism, Digital Video and Cinema (DVC), Integrative Advertising, and another one I can't think of. You'll know since you had to choose to apply to get in, but I'll give you the journalism rundown. They train you in all of them in two years (electives in and out of SMAD to graduate) and then you'll specialize the last two in your concentration. Not too bad. I'd suggest writing classes and/or art classes outside of the major to broaden your scope of ideas and hone them to make your SMAD life easier. Grammar and creative nonfiction writing are good ones! Basic story structure and details helped me a lot. Look for anything art/design too that seems like it could cross over like photography or graphic design or something. Anything to make you get better grades and get different points of view. Big lifesaver for me. I was a director for Breeze TV and got it off the ground in 2017. Best time of my life! Night and day difference to when we started to where it is now. If you want to work in a newsroom or the news studio, that's the place to be. Look for Professor Parkhurst and tell him Ethan Pelino sent you. He should know me still. That should get your foot in the door. They are looking for people every semester, but as long as you're around and showing interest, you may get in. It is competitive and space is limited, but it's always worth a shot. It's how I got the Director job. Not a guarantee, but a damn good shot at it. Take risks, even if you think they won't work. The results could change your life. It did for me, and it can for you. There's The Breeze, the newspaper. They're based off campus, but are a constant presence on campus. Talk to Brad Jenkins or get in touch with any Professor in SMAD to get to him. Cool guy, and loves his journalists to death. Fun to work for! Not necessarily SMAD related, but there is a radio station that students operate off campus. Don't know much, but ask enough people and you may find your way in. If there is an Org Night coming up, I'd go to it or look for one on the school calendar coming up. Easy way to find the Orgs I mentioned. Get used to working in Harrison Hall. 98% of SMAD classes are there. Classes are manageable as long as you start on top of them and stay there. Stress is a common occurrence in SMAD. Staying ahead will save your bacon and make your mental state and grades better in the long run. Give yourself more time than you think on journalism assignments is my biggest advice. Like a 3-4 day window. 1 week is even better. There were more than a few times where a source for a story fell through in my intro to journalism class and it went sideways quick. If you tell your professor what happened and it's reasonable explanation is within a few days of the deadline, they'll give extensions. Usually a couple days or a week depending on how important the source to the story is. It's happened to me before on more than one occasion. Just ask! Don't go up the night before and beg for help. Give a couple days of heads up so it's not too late. If I wasnt almost finished with the first draft with three or four days left to turn it in, I would be stressed out and the story could suffer. It doesn't have to be perfect the first and your can get new sources until you're turning it in. The quicker you act, the easier the reporting is and the better your story will be. Also need to give sources time to respond. Be the most delightful pain in the ass and you will get far in the major. Persistence is your best weapon! I would also advise meeting with your adviser regularly (freshman and SMAD) to be a familiar face with them. I knew lots of people that never saw their advisers and suffered for it. They're good for networking and general stuff. I saved a semester or two of headaches with scheduling my classes the right way to graduate on time. ALWAYS ASK FOR OVERRIDES to get into a class if enrollment is full. I feel like I was lucky, but it usually works more often than not. SMAD classes are small--16-25 people usually. Since rooms often have 30-40 chairs in some cases, it increases your odds of slipping in are decent. If it's in a lab that's not in the basement, probably less likely. I had to do this three times in two semesters, and it saved me from SO MUCH suffering. In the end, just be persistent, ask lots of questions, do everything necessary to help yourself succeed and be a person to count on, and you'll be set. Best of luck to you and your endeavors! It was and still is the best decision I ever made to apply to SMAD. You'll love it as much as I did. Keep your head up high, nose to the ground, and an open mind and nothing can stop you.

comment,RIP jmu,"Just got an email saying they aren't cancelling classes despite parts of campus being prone to flooding and the Shenandoah Valley facing a ""significant impact"" with strong winds and heavy rains. So basically, roads are going to be dangerous and the transit center everyone uses to bus in/out of campus is going to he under water, but by God is school ever in session. I've said it once and I'll say it again: I understand what a hassle it is to cancel classes (especially when enthusiastic professors decide to take advantage of Saturday makeup classes), but we have Canvas. There is no reason professors can't post assignments through there and save everyone the hassle of dealing with this mess. Several students *and* professors are expressing concern over their homes being flooded and the safety of the roads. I imagine our professors who live over in the old part of town don't want to be lecturing when they have pets, electronics, and everything else in their house potentially in danger. I may sound overly paranoid (and perhaps I am), but doing assignments online is such an easy fix when the university isn't sure whether opening or closing is the right call. EDIT: Apartment management just emailed me a big safety thing. They're urging us to stay away from windows and to not go outside unless it's absolutely necessary since weather conditions may deteriorate rapidly, or appear safe and suddenly get worse again. I strongly urge every one of you reading this to contact your professors and see if they plan to hold class Friday (maybe Thursday as well). The odds are some of them will want to cancel. For the rest of us, I think Walmart still has canoes out front.",2018-09-11 15:41:07,30

comment,"If you don’t want the vaccine, go to a different school. This is getting ridiculous.",You do realize people that are vaccinated can still carry Covid and the vaccines have lower effectiveness (still very high) to variants? If people who are vaccinated want to keep wearing a mask let them. They could also have a cold or something and not want to spread that.,2021-07-10 10:39:01,15
comment,"If you don’t want the vaccine, go to a different school. This is getting ridiculous.","Whataboutism. I’ve weighed the risks, factors, and took into consideration nearly every piece of data with the virus and history regarding both the government and vaccine manufacturers. I have no reason to trust either of them, and considering my personal life and how Covid is most likely to affect me, I’ve reasonably decided that the vaccine poses a larger threat than the actual virus does. At this point, nearly everyone who desires to have the vaccine has done so by now. I pose no threat to those people and with the remainder of people (nonvaxd) I can logically assume that their health choice is in their hands, especially if it comes to a situation where they cannot take it. It is in those situations that reasonable measures are in place to assure that any likelihood of a virus is mitigated to avoid potential exposure.",2021-07-10 09:17:00,-3
comment,"If you don’t want the vaccine, go to a different school. This is getting ridiculous.","Yes but logically how can you make that decision? If you are to “roll the dice” on an unknown thing whether it be getting covid or getting vaccine. Why would you not trust a vaccine created by the worlds top scientists over a debilitating disease that has killed millions around the world? There’s been almost zero vaccine deaths and so many covid deaths. It’s also just being a good citizen. If we all don’t get vaccinated the virus will continue to spread among the unvaccinated. Even if it doesn’t kill them it will start to mutate over time. There could be a world where because of these mutations the virus becomes even more deadly or worse, is unaffected by the vaccines. We would have to start all over again. This is why it’s so important for everyone to get their vaccine. How is your one friend going to the hospital from getting the vaccine = to the millions of people who have been hospitalized or killed by the virus. Your logic doesn’t make any sense. I could easily just tell you that I took the vaccine and had no side affects at all and that would cancel out with your friend.",2021-07-10 09:46:18,3
comment,"If you don’t want the vaccine, go to a different school. This is getting ridiculous.","Well, speaking realistically, we’ve observed wide-scale covid for over a year and a half now. We have yet to see wide-scale vaccination results, except for the tests that have no long-term data available. I can “roll the dice” on the virus because I can predict nearly, if at all, how the virus will affect me. I cannot predict how the vaccine will affect me. In one specific case of my friend, said individual has significant underlying conditions. After consulting two doctors familiar with their health, neither were able to predict the serious hospital-bound reaction my friend ended up having. If they couldn’t predict such a severe reaction, or even warn my friend of a potential side effect, how I could reasonably believe they have my best interests in mind? In terms of trust, they’ve done nothing to win it. I get it - science changes. However, I’ve observed a lack of consistency, no accountability (can’t forget all of the “experts” who skirted the rules and faced no repercussions), and no transparency, either. Don’t get me wrong, I think there’s plenty to reason that the virus is severe - but I am certain I do not fall into the at risk category. It’s been proven that natural health is sufficient enough to fight this virus, including exercise/dieting/vitamin consumption. Offering tons of incentives (unhealthy at that, including donuts, beer, and even guns??) doesn’t actually give me a sense of urgency, when physical/mental health should’ve been promoted all along. Trust me, they don’t give a shit about your health. Also, I don’t necessarily like the idea of this “good citizen”/“right thing to do” mentality. There are a lot of factors that contribute to death that “good citizens” don’t do - like driving distracted/under the influence or firearm safety. Point is, I am alone in my decision to calculate my own risks and consider how my life should go. Within reason, I am subjected to abiding by the necessary obligations in order to prevent any covid from spreading. Otherwise, the decisions outside of my personal life and immediate circle are up to the beholder of their own destiny - not me. Responsibility, at some point, is held to the individual and not those around them.",2021-07-10 12:49:52,-1

comment,Bad experiences at JMU,"I went to JMU from 2018-2021. I ended up transferring to UMW. I belong to this sub because I am still fond of the school and like hearing about what’s going on. I pretty much left for the reasons you are talking about. But I also just needed a smaller school which wasn’t JMU’s fault. People are going to tell you that you have a bad attitude, you’re not trying, you’re too judgy, etc. I don’t really think it comes down to that. I think JMU is a sink or swim type of place and not everyone can handle that. As a freshman I lived in the dorms and dabbled in various social groups. I drank and went to parties because that’s what everyone did, had some fun, but it didn’t lead to any meaningful social connections. I was okay with my roommate and I also had a best friend who lived in the dorms with me. But for the life of me I could not relate to anyone else in the dorms. I had some friends I met in a lab but we would just get food together after lab and it would feel weird to hang out with them in other situations. So I was quite isolated. There was really no one for me at JMU. I also was just beginning to get symptoms of some psychiatric illnesses and was trying to isolate to make it less noticeable. This is also not JMU’s fault. It just wasn’t a place where I could actually get better. Campus counseling center wouldn’t even see me, and I found it difficult to get treatment in Harrisonburg. Eventually the pandemic sent us home. I had a psychotic break, and then transferred to a smaller and more accessible school. The problems I had with JMU are mostly things I knew coming in but thought I could handle. Class size, for one, was a serious issue for me. I just felt lost, but coming I thought I’d like it. I also had so many terrible professors. Since transferring I’ve only had great to amazing professors. At JMU when I went to office hours the professors were unhelpful or even disrespectful/inappropriate. And the students I met didn’t really care about the topics we were studying. Most of them complained about random stuff about the course. This could be because they were lower level classes but it annoyed me. I found at my new school I can make friends more easily. I’m still not fantastic at it, but I am happy with my friends. The classroom is more conducive to conversation among fellow students, and the activities outside of class are easy to make friends at. This was NOT the case at JMU. I get so mad when people say “join a club” to join friends. As if you couldn’t think of that yourself. I tried so many clubs at JMU, things I was genuinely interested in, and I found it was sooo hard to fit in with people. My advice to you is to NOT transfer though. Unless you’re failing your classes or seriously ill. I transferred because I couldn’t function at JMU. The next two years will be over before you even know it. Transferring throws such a wrench in everything. I bet you’ll make a friend unexpectedly at JMU. It just hasn’t happened for you yet. But keep grinding away at your studies and finish!! You’ve got this. I hope my perspective was helpful.",2022-07-15 18:10:41,24

I’m hoping with time this will change! The best advice I can offer you is to not give up in getting involved in clubs that suit your interests. The first two clubs I joined were difficult to make any friends in(even though I was going to volunteer and social events and carpooling people) and it wasn’t until I joined a third one that I finally made some new connections.",2022-07-15 20:24:59,5
comment,Bad experiences at JMU,"Hi there, long time ago I once was at JMU (graduated in '11) and the one thing I loved more than anything was finding people who were passionate about all sorts of things. From clubs to academia to nightlife I actually think JMU has a lot to offer. I don't know what you're majoring in but one of the things I found very amazing was how many different programs at JMU had fantastic opportunities for engaging in really active projects or research opportunities. I totally can understand that the school culture can have shifted in my decade since attending, however what I look back at and understand now more as an adult is the experience of anything in life is what you make of it. Take the time to consider maybe starting a group for something you're interested in or would like to explore. Also look to see if any meetup groups exist for what interests you. One thing I think college really helped evolved for myself and probably others is its in your hands to do the searching and exploring. The best part of living in today's world is the access to the internet and its ability to connect with people. Just as you have here on reddit :) The JMU family extends beyond campus and the current student body you're apart of now as well.

comment,Bad experiences at JMU,"I had a bad experience. The faculty in my major punished me for violating rules that didn’t exist, even acknowledging that fact in the meeting as they did it to set a precedent for rules that were published shortly afterward. I had a tough time my senior year navigating those relationships. I had friends, but I also felt a bit like an outcast and becoming a pariah in the major kind of exacerbated that fact. I don’t regret going there, I guess. I got what I wanted from doing so. Despite their best efforts, I worked in my field (performing arts) full time for a decade before the pandemic destroyed the industry for everyone. There even came a point where the same faculty who unjustly sanctioned me later came to me for networking opportunities for students. That was vindicating. But I literally haven’t been back to campus since I graduated. I didn’t walk. I have exactly three friends I’ve retained from my time there, and about two dozen professional acquaintances. The fundraising department stopped calling me when I wouldn’t stop bringing up JMU’s shitty record at handling on campus sexual abuse. As far as I’m concerned JMU can lick my balls. If you take anything away from this though it should be this: stay focused on your goals. The idea of college as a four year wonderland full of “finding yourself” is bullshit. Education is a service you are paying for. Get your money’s worth, keep the friends you can, build a professional network wherever you can. Take solace in the knowledge that there are as many or more people like us at every college as their are University Superfans. There isn’t anything wrong with you. Know that that this isn’t the end of your life. It’s just the beginning. You’ll make it through this, like so many have before you.",2022-07-15 22:14:35,4
comment,Bad experiences at JMU,"Hi I had bad experiences there too (I'm actually transferring to another school this fall). The problems I faced were the issues in the dorm (almost everyone on the floor was rude and there would be parties going on in the dorms everynight even during finals yet the ra wouldn't do anything besides text in the gc). My other issues were with how limited the academic system works; the strict rules I would have to follow to be able to complete major and the gen eds/ clusters that felt more like a way to slow me down in my pursuit of accomplishing the major. In addition, I also had trouble with my advisor who would act in a rude Manner and never answered questions. This was a big theme I noticed while attending rather than getting answers to questions I always got""sorry I don't know the answer to that you'll have to ask \_\_\_\_\_"" even for some of the most basic questions. I could go into a more thorough account of all the issues I faced if I thought about it longer but I've been focused on other things since summer began. &#x200B; I'd also like to mention that not all my experiences were bad; I joined a Fraternity and made lots of close friends who really helped me with my mental health and I did have some teachers who were pretty interesting.",2022-07-18 21:47:29,2
comment,Bad experiences at JMU,"I graduated in 2021 from 5 years of undergrad at JMU and I’m now in a graduate program. I also am not a party person and I found it difficult to find genuine friendships BUT it is possible. I think trying to make the most of it, finding organizations that interest you and finding a person or two in them or in your major is a huge game changer. It wasn’t until I started working at UREC and getting to know the people that were in a lot of my classes that I felt like I had a place. I am willing to admit it was 100% my own fault I’m a townie and went home a lot as a freshman so I didn’t put effort into it. But I think at the end of the day if you can find 1-2 friends who you truly care about and vice versa and you get the degree then you’re in a great place. As much as people claim college is the “best years of your life” that’s really sad if it’s true because for most that means the best time of their life was getting wasted 24/7.

I don't feel comfortable going anywhere on campus and prefer to just stay in my room. People in my dorm last year were cliquey and mean, as well, so even going out in the hallway made me uneasy.

comment,Bad experiences at JMU,"It’s been very difficult to make friends, I have felt isolated since the day I walked onto campus. I have felt downright suicidal at times because of how alone I really feel. My freshman year was 2020, so the pandemic did not help and I understand that part of it didn’t have much to do with the school itself. I don’t fit in with the frat/sorority and party culture, and I knew that I probably wouldn’t going in. I assumed that I could find people like me somewhere on campus, simply due to how big the student body really is. Also because that’s how JMU markets itself, as having something for everyone. I didn’t think it would be entirely frat bros and keg stands, but it is. I’ve made friends along the way, but they were all superficial and basically just people who wanted to party rather than getting to know eachother and forming some kind of relationship. I’ve cut those people off, and am back to square one. I find the student body very clique-y and exclusive, no matter what area of student life I try to bridge. As friendly as people say JMU’s campus is, I have not encountered many friendly faces. JMU’s culture is exclusively tied to partying, there is no academic focus whatsoever in my experience. Which is irritating to me, because that’s what I’m shelling out money for, and the whole reason I decided to go to college.

I cant talk post-covid, but during covid there was so much fear. Not of covid, but of the people. There was a lack of trust. If you were new to a friend group, you felt all eyes on you and people avoided you because they were afraid you were going to rat them out. There was no desire to meet new people and the only way to meet people seemed to be Tinder. The policing was annoying (like having to be 20 feet apart while throwing a football outside never made sense to me), but the education was terrible. The professors and the students didn't give a shit about anything during covid.

comment,Bad experiences at JMU,"Sounds about right, and I graduated almost 20 years ago, i.e. nothing really changed between my time there in the 2000s vs. yours in the 2010s. I was relatively local (Augusta County), and always felt like something of an ""other"" on campus because I didn't fit the ""rich kid from NOVA"" stereotype, and didn't like the way that many JMU students stereotyped the locals. I also had a healthy dose of skepticism for school spirit after my experience with that in high school, where I found that ""school spirit"" was a cover for some of the worst aspects of the school's culture, so I definitely wasn't about to be part of that ""I bleed purple"" crowd. I get all of the alumni stuff in my inbox for campus and the local (DC/Baltimore) alumni chapter, but I can't bring myself to actually go to anything, especially seeing as I don't drink alcohol anymore (too many events for adults seem to revolve around alcohol, which really gets old after a while). I ran into the Baltimore group on a Sunday evening in 2014 one time by chance, and in interacting with them, they seemed nice enough, but I also got the distinct sense that, other than going to the same college, we had nothing in common. At nearly 20 years out from graduation, I feel a lot closer to the people I went to high school with than the folks that I went to college with, since we all had a more shared experience growing up, even though I no longer live in that area. A month or so after I graduated from JMU, I bought a big diploma frame and put my diploma in it, which I displayed for many years. When I moved to my current residence in 2017, I decided that I was not going to hang it up again, because it no longer reflected who I was. Being perfectly blunt in hindsight, I didn't really need to attend college at all based on what kind of work makes me happy, and would have been well served going to some sort of trade school after high school, but it had been more or less preordained by my parents that I would attend college, and that was that, and I definitely got a ""these sorts of jobs are not for you"" vibe from them when discussing some occupations. I hated the kind of work that my parents wanted for me, and eventually got out of it. I now work a job in transportation that is part of a union and pays a ridiculous amount of money, and my parents eventually came around on things. They know that I'm happy, and that I'm doing very well for myself, and so they have no complaints. But JMU was just an uncomfortable time where I didn't fit in very well culturally, and didn't see much success. The regret about going there isn't so much about going to JMU vs. another school, but more that I didn't necessarily need to go to college at all in order to be successful at something that I was passionate about, and that college was a waste of four years that I could have done something more productive with.",2022-07-16 11:39:01,3

JMU is not exclusively frat bros and sorority girls- it just isn’t. I think percentage wise less than 10-20% of the campus is involved in Greek life. Like others have said, there are tons of ways to get involved and meet different people. More than anything though, you need to change your attitude. There’s no reason to judge people who like to drink and go to parties, for some people that’s what they enjoy. They aren’t bothering you for not going? Not wanting to engage in drinking and party culture is absolutely okay and there are many folks who feel the same way, but judging other young adults for wanting to drink, do drugs, party, etc. in college is not the move. Also looking for people who are “like you” isn’t totally the point of going to a big college or any college. When I was in school I was friends with frat bros as well as people who barely drank and would never be interested in that type of environment. College is a beautiful time to engage and learn from people totally different from you. Most people are nice, most people are helpful- don’t let a few bad interactions or cold conversations shape your view of 20,000 people.

comment,Bad experiences at JMU,"I would definitely check out organizations like UPB, Safe Rides, Student Government, archery, quidditch or even the cultural organizations (you don’t have to be of that culture to join, they are all very welcoming). I am so sorry you’re feeling the way you are especially since your first year definitely made things more difficult. College can be such an overwhelming experience on its own. I encourage you to keep an open mind as you explore different student organizations and try to embrace the process of making new friends even though it can be uncomfortable and a little awkward! As someone who had no interest in frats/sororities or partying, I was still able to find my community at JMU so I just want to let you know it exists and I hope you’re able to find your own little community too :)",2022-07-15 22:21:25,5

They BORROWED money for the new Convo center. Students will be paying for it over the next few decades. JMU is like someone who has no money who then decides to max out their credit card on a TV and then makes the minimum payment until it is paid off. Some people will mention that JMU does not have a very big endowment. That is because they borrow money from outside sources and pay interest on those loans when they could have borrowed from the endowment and pay the interest back in like what most other schools do.,2020-09-05 12:11:15,3

post,Dear JMU,"Dear JMU Hello students, This is your president, Alger, and I hope you may consider me a friend as well. I’d like to address some recent news concerning our wonderful school, so please bear with me as I do my best to bring you guys into the fold. I believe transparency should be a priority for any sort of administration. 1) You all have probably heard of the news of the renaming of Jackson, Ashby, and Maury halls, And I think it’s great that JMU as a community is taking an active role in bringing such things as these wrongly named halls to my attention. I’d love to hear some community feedback as to what these should be renamed to, I’m personally quite fond of naming one of them Hallsy McHallface plus it has the added benefit of sounding like Halsey (I’m quite a fan of hers). So please let me know if your ideas in the comment section below! 2) I realize this isn’t recent news, but I would like to also take this opportunity to respond to some criticisms, this is for u/ZeltronTheHellspawn who brought up a lack of toilet paper in the men’s shall bathroom. I would like to assure everyone that from now on this problem is fixed, your butts need not worry about having no toilet paper anymore. 3) Lastly, this problem is very much recent, minutes old in fact. Unbeknownst to you guys, I must confess, I have an archenemy, I know not his face or his real name but he goes by u/ReverseDaddyAlger. I implore you to disregard whatever he says. His goals are beyond our understanding but his actions have had direct implications upon you, the students of JMU. If you recall, early in the 2019 fall semester, roughly 10 months ago, there was a power outage. This outage was in fact due to my enemy, who is also your enemy. I thought he was destroyed during that outage, as he had went into the plant and never came out, as a result, I have left my guard down and I sincerely apologize for that lapse in judgement. I also believe he was behind another major event at JMU, the infamous 'angry bible man'. I have reason to believe he and his acolytes were paid actors who were hired to cause chaos on campus. I do apologize for the darker tone in that last part, but as I mentioned, I would like to establish a policy of transparency with you, my beloved students. As evidenced by recent post, many of you miss JMU and are eager to return, I assure you that your return to on-campus school is guaranteed as is my solemn promise to keep a continuous rapport with you as to any and all updates that may affect your day to day lives at JMU. Go Dukes! Sincerely and lovingly, President Alger",2020-06-29 21:11:51,76

comment,NBC News article publishes about JMU’s hidden fees,"The links have already been posted in the responses, here, so I won't bother posting them again. But why is it being said there is a lack of transparency there? The information is all publicly available and the breakdown of where the comprehensive fees go is set out in a pie chart for readability. There is no attempt to hide that information. I have a sincere question: how could the university make it more available? I'm not just trying to be dismissive of the concerns, I genuinely want to know what you all think in regards to that. This was a JLARC study done a few years back and released in January 2015 on college costs in Virginia. If you want to look into the drivers behind higher ed costs, it's a good place to look: [http://jlarc.virginia.gov/higher-ed-cost.asp](http://jlarc.virginia.gov/higher-ed-cost.asp) About a year-and-a-half prior, JLARC released this report specifically on non-academic costs and it talks a good bit about athletics: [http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/Reports/Rpt443.pdf](http://jlarc.virginia.gov/pdfs/Reports/Rpt443.pdf) Now, all of this information is a little dated at this point, but it gives some good insights into the path that got us here as well as some good statewide comparisons. In addition, the administration has actually used this information since these reports to make attempts at addressing these problems. The last thing I will say is that while I completely understand the commentary about not donating because of things like this, taking that action only perpetuates the problem. By making that statement you help ensure that the costs will continue to be passed on to the students. If you want to limit your donation so it doesn't go to athletics, then do that, but I'd just ask you to reconsider a position that adds to the problem. I put my money where my mouth is on this one and if you think I don't have my problems with the administration, you would be mistaken.",2020-03-10 06:38:25,3

The 2013 report splits it by sport and football plus general athletic funds was only half the student fee. I looked over the Report of Intercollegiate Athletics for 2019. These are my findings, please correct me if there is a issue. They are sneaky with this budget. Football has a deficit $5.7M. Non-program specific (Where the student provided funds go) has a surplus of $23.7M. When you add up every listed program funds you have a deficit of exactly $23.7M. What this looks like to me is that students are collectively directly paying $5.7M directly to the football team. What make this even worse is if we define ""bulk"" as more than 50% then the bulk of the athletics support staff, the bulk of the athletics advertising and fundraising expense, all of the athletic facility operations expenses (Think rent and bills), all the athletic facility debt service (Think mortgage payment) on Veteran's Memorial Park, Bridgeforth Stadium, Athletics exclusive facilities at University Park, and Atlantic Union Bank Center (New Convo), and the indirect institutional cost (Cost to use services like the university lawyer, accountants, etc) come from the non-program specific fund. That is about $17.5M more that is paid by the students to support athletics (We don't know which group because it is all mixed here, I would assume it majority of it goes to football and basketball). Based on this document, $5.73M of student fees goes directly to football, $2.38M goes directly to men's basketball, and $2.52M goes directly to women's basketball. This brings up a total of $10.58M of student funds that goes DIRECTLY to those programs. This does not count the associated expenses charged directly to the non-program specific fund. This comes up to a total of at least $19.08M (or 46%) that comes from student fees and goes to support Football and Basketball directly or indirectly.",2020-03-10 21:17:42,3

comment,NBC News article publishes about JMU’s hidden fees,"The fact of the matter is about the direct COST and the fact that the university would rather hide the amount that gets pulled from tuition and other fees. They’re doing this for a reason otherwise this wouldn’t be a problem. I understand that other state schools in the university receive more funding from the GA as well as from donors. You also have to look at the demographic of the GA. It’s majority republican and we have few alumni from JMU that are represented in the VA General Assembly so more funds get directed to the states’s top tier universities and then the scraps get thrown to their backyard AKA Mason. JMU’s student demographic is mainly upper middle class. They can afford to cut a check to the university. Students that attend UVA or VT *do* pay less in these athletic fees and they *do* have higher tuition but at the end of the day, they’re charging their students more for the EDUCATION aspect of the university rather than the short pleasure of a school’s athletic team. At the end of the day— you are attending a university to receive a degree and you use that as a tool to better your future and advance your career. You said that most people that graduate from JMU end up having mediocre salaries. If JMU invested more of that money into the EDUCATIONAL (and really, the **CORE** part of attending higher education), then more students would probably receive higher paying jobs. As far as those links that you added, the first one shows the breakdown of vague descriptions of allocation of money from tuition. The second one is a jarred financial report that’s written using jargon that most college students can’t understand. Do you see the problem of the lack of transparency of where our money is going???",2020-03-10 01:37:43,6

comment,NBC News article publishes about JMU’s hidden fees,"Yes this is mostly accurate. Depending to the point you're trying to make I would say the bigger takeaway is that the athletics budget is 80% from student fees, they spend 52 mil and only bring in 11 mil is actual revenue, and thats including 3 mil in donations. You can see the debt owed for each athletic facility on page 12 of the most recent budget. 72mil in debt for a mens basketball program that makes less ticket revenue than the womens program is a huge gamble. Most programs build the team success then invest in the program (we did this with the football stadium [natl title then expansion]) but we're basically praying we're going to figure out the mens team now that we have a fancy stadium. I would guess Coach Rowe will not be back next year. I would argue that convo is sooo bad it made it near impossible for us to get any decent recruits. We only had one court for both teams to practice with, support facilities (training room, weight room, locker rooms, etc) were very small and outdated, and the place just simply looked like a dump. I remember coach brooks a few years back saying he'd have recruits in for a visit ask ""is this really where you play games"". We'll see what happens, if the men's team gets good we'll have better odds of moving up a conference. Our best chance was probably Uconn's spot in the big east and emulating villanova or butler (fcs football, big time basketball)",2020-03-10 22:38:18,3

post,Ladies be careful if attending Harrisonburg Regal Theater….,"Ladies be careful if attending Harrisonburg Regal Theater…. This afternoon I went to the theater to see Dear Evan Hansen. I was by myself and I was going to attend the 6 pm showing. I was early and I live like 45 minutes from campus so I was waiting in the parking lot in my car with my car doors locked. This man in a white Jeep backed in across from me so that his vehicle was facing me. I didn’t think anything of it at first because it’s a theater and a public space so I assumed he was going to see a movie, he was by himself as far as I could tell. I happened to look up because I had a feeling something was off and he was leaned forward holding his phone on top of the steering wheel taking photos of me. I know he was taking photos because as soon as I saw this I ducked down so my face was hidden behind the dash of my car and when I peeked back up he had taken his phone down and slowly pulled out of the parking space. He came in the theater parking lot on the Buffalo Wild Wings side and I was parked on the entry side as if I would go to Texas Roadhouse. I called my mom and she told me to forget the movie and come home because this man had a photo of me, the car I was in, and the license plate. As I went to leave he was driving probably 5 mph if not slower toward the parking lot exit. I headed toward the exit away from him and he stopped in the middle of the road on the way to the exit. I did not get a good look at him or the license plate just the vehicle. This isn’t the first time something like this has happened to me in Harrisonburg and I wanted to spread awareness so that people (especially girls) are aware of their surroundings so this hopefully doesn’t happen to them. I carry a safety alarm but still felt unsafe entering and exiting the theater which is why I didn’t see my movie.",2021-09-26 20:55:34,74

comment,Ladies be careful if attending Harrisonburg Regal Theater….,It’s fine I’m just glad I’m okay and I’m hoping maybe it won’t happen to anyone else. Or at the least everyone is aware of their surroundings. It’s a huge problem. A man tried to open my car door when I was getting gas at Costco last semester. I just want people to be aware. I’ve lived in/near this area my entire life and I’ve never seen it this bad nor has this ever happened to me at the theater.,2021-09-26 21:15:04,20
comment,Ladies be careful if attending Harrisonburg Regal Theater….,"Absolutely! It’s what my mom and I have talked about and why I bought an alarm because after the car door incident and knowing masks policies on campus I needed something loud because I’m not a very loud person anyway. I’m very sure he texted someone my photograph with my car information because my car was in the photo with the plate number which is why I left when I did rather than take the chance. I’m hyper aware of my surroundings in general. He never got out of the Jeep, just sat there for a good 10 minutes or so across from me until I made no move to get out.",2021-09-26 21:32:24,11

comment,Ladies be careful if attending Harrisonburg Regal Theater….,"This comment is so messed up and here’s why. Don’t start with “if this is real”. It was very much real and very much terrifying. I debated even posting here because I knew I’d get comments like this trying to tell me I’m lying or making it up. I wouldn’t ever lie about something like this. Secondly, no I didn’t report this to the police. Here’s why, this is the THIRD time something like this has happened to me. I tried to report similar things last semester and when I reported it I was told that until someone makes a physical move toward me such as trying to grab me or physically has harmed me in some way they would not do anything because a crime was not committed. It was a he said she said situation because while this very much happened, he could very well have said that he didn’t do anything of the sort. You don’t have to believe me and I don’t even know why I’m bothering trying to convince you because you appear to be one of those people that until it happens to you or right in front of you “it doesn’t happen”. He was there maybe fifteen minutes if that because it was right before I was going into the theater and at that point I left because it felt very unsafe. I’m probably gonna get downvoted for commenting back at you but it really irritates me every time I see other girls post about situations like this there are always people making comments like oh this isn’t real or this doesn’t happen.",2021-09-27 07:17:07,16

comment,Ladies be careful if attending Harrisonburg Regal Theater….,That was not the point of this post at all and if you thought it was you’re clearly missing the point. The point of this post was to educate others so they hopefully don’t go through what I did and at the very least know to be aware of their surroundings. I didn’t say all men are bad because I don’t believe that but I felt extremely unsafe in this situation. Tell me when have your ever seen a girl yelling after a guy things she wants to do to him because of what he’s wearing or a girl following a guy around with the intent of shoving him into a car to do something bad to him? Not once hm. These comments in general are messed up. I was trying to just ignore it but apparently that’s not working for you.

comment,Football Cancelled for Fall,"Comprehensive fee is $5,080 per year, tuition is $7,250 per year. NCAA athletics accounts for $2,159 of the comprehensive fee.

Athletics accounts for about 7.5% of total academic costs (using JMU’s estimated cost of $28,426). Or in total fees to the university, about 18% of the total per year. Should we still be charged the full amount of the comprehensive fee? Of course not... we’re paying for things we don’t receive, that’s a rip off. Why should we pay for busses, sports, etc. that we don’t receive the “product” of. But, figured I’d make sure y’all know it’s not “half our tuition”.",2020-08-07 18:04:44,8

post,PSA: Semester Break Work is a scam (CutCo/Vector),"PSA: Semester Break Work is a scam (CutCo/Vector) There's someone (or some people) going around campus distributing business cards for working over the winter break, but the cards are deceiving, as the company behind it (Vector Marketing) is a known MLM that preys on college students to work for them, without actually providing the benefits that are promised. (Hence why the company doesn't list itself on there). They've been caught violating JMU's policies in the past (solicitation via Canvas). If you see any of these cards lying around, discard it, or better yet, report it to a staff member so we can get this off our campus.",2024-12-04 11:02:27,72

comment,PSA: Semester Break Work is a scam (CutCo/Vector),"Guys. Be real. Truth is always somewhere in the middle. No it’s not MLM. They aren’t paid off of bringing ppl on. Yes, my friends that have sold cutco have tried to recruit me too, but it wasn’t financial gain off of me if I decided to do it. Yes, they start with family and friends and it’s a much bigger advantage if you have a decent network.. like almost everything in life. (paid to show it, make more for sales, it’s kitchen stuff… not everyone will afford it … but everyone that buys it, loves it). No they didn’t become the scum of the earth starting a new job lol. It’s not for everyone, it’s great experience for most future jobs (making calls, networking, selling, etc). If you want to make $500-2k during the break and don’t want to work a traditional job hourly to do so, it’s worth checking out. Not for everyone, nothing ever is. But if you enjoy it, chances are, you’ll probably make some good money and the product is great, so you won’t ever feel bad when ppl buy it (it’s too expensive to buy because someone pity’s you lol).

During the semester you’re constantly stressed with nonstop assignments that you’ve gotta stay on top of. Spring break is supposed to relieve that tension by giving you a period of time where you don’t have to do work and teachers can’t assign anything. This new system just gives us more time to get stuff done while also giving teachers an excuse to assign more. I can’t help but feel there’s better ways to keep kids on campus.,2020-10-23 15:16:50,8

I pulled this from the JMU website if you were wondering, you can check for yourself.","Sorry if I was being a little angrier then I should’ve been, I didn’t have much sleep when I wrote this. I get that they don’t want students leaving campus, going on trips where they could get re-exposed, and bringing the virus back to campus. My one thing is, they already sent us home for a month while campus had a massive outbreak, becoming a hotspot with hundreds cases. Even though they sent us home during classes there was a massive risk associated with sending potentially infected students back to their families. Students still could’ve been exposed while at home and could’ve brought it back to campus at reopening. It didn’t phase them then. Now this semester, they’re planning on sending us home for thanksgiving break and keeping us there until the end of the semester. This creates a second mass exodus from campus putting families at risk of their students bringing home the virus. This also threatens spring semester as kids after finals have plenty of time to go on trips before returning to campus in January. Plenty of time to catch the virus and drag it back to JMU. This still doesn’t phase the university. Now for some strange reason they decide to mince our break up into bits to keep kids from going on trips or traveling home and returning with the illness. If that was an issue why weren’t they worried about it when setting up the other 2 mass migrations to and from campus? It’s just frustratingly inconsistent, especially when the campus cases are now at stable numbers. Just wish they’d decide on a strategy and stick too it. That or make up some better options that put less strain on the students.",2020-10-25 18:39:53,1

post,to the young lady that nearly hit my dog and me today:,"to the young lady that nearly hit my dog and me today: And to anyone else that frequently drives, please take a second to look up from your phone while you are behind the wheel. Today my dog and I were in a crosswalk, with the pedestrian crossing light on. A young woman was taking a right on red and didn't see me or my dog. Thank God her windows were down because I screamed at her to stop, which she did and no one was hurt. My intention with this post is not to shame this person for not seeing me, but to let everyone here know that people do walk on cross walks and taking a right on red is very dangerous for everyone involved. Just as a general sentiment, be more aware on these streets. My pup and I would appreciate it.",2022-03-20 18:28:01,72

It is so true--a majority of drivers do not understand crosswalks and yielding to pedestrians proper, it's incredibly frustrating on both ends.

Then exchange numbers. That's basically what everyone is doing. Don't get food alone if you can help it. Going alone is a missed opportunity to spend 30 minutes getting to know people. Once you get food with people it will be easy to start inviting each other to things other than just food.

comment,This was the response when I asked about that story posted on JMU's IG yesterday.,"If they're smart, they won't send us home unless they're ordered to by the government. JMU has to refund us room, board, and parking passes because if they don't, that'll be a class-action lawsuit waiting to happen, and that means money lost on lawyers and bad PR. And even if they refund us as they should, bringing us back and sending us home after two weeks is a terrible business decision anyway because they'd still be losing money -- and there would probably still be a class-action lawsuit. So at this point, the best business decision for JMU to make is to quit sending vague messages, do their absolute best to keep students and faculty safe this semester, and stand fast on their decision to reopen campus.",2020-08-06 23:30:26,17

comment,GOOD LUCK THIS SEMESTER,"If I may interject as a parent of two recent grads; you are at a great school, one which will set you up for success in life if you let it. But in addition to your classes, be sure to network yourself in clubs and such while you are there; a lot of the people you meet will end up being friends or business associates somewhere down the line. Both of my kids got great jobs after graduating, but the one that networked more is in better general circumstances overall. Good luck and GO DUKES!",2018-08-27 13:36:48,8
comment,GOOD LUCK THIS SEMESTER,"Also for new students: Relax and be yourselves. You do not want everyone to be friends with a fake you because it will be exhausting to maintain. You want to make friends who like you for being you. Work with your FROGs/TOPAs. Your FROGs/TOPAs are their for you the entire year and will be putting on events for you to go to. These events are there to help you and your frog trust each other for when you need your FROGs/TOPAs help. Go to Student Org Night. I believe it is this Friday the 31st from 5p-8p at Hillside Field. This is where you can meet all of the clubs and Orgs on campus. Joining a Club or Org is one of the best ways to make friends at JMU. When you leave your email you are agreeing to get more information on the Club/Org including how to join. Because of this, if a club seams slightly interesting to you you should add you name to their information mailing list. If you have additional questions on Student Org Night ask your FROG or TOPA. Use a planer. If you do not have a planer you should Buy A Planer, Pick up a planer at the bookstore (If they are giving them out this year), or use Google Calendar. You should put ALL classes and club meetings on the planer. You should also put project deadlines on the planer (From your course syllabus). This will make it easier for you to keep track of the chaos that is college. Also try to slow down if you can. College will go by faster than you think and you don't want to discover this when you are a senior. Good Luck!",2018-08-27 09:42:53,5

comment,Crayola cover band party,"If you were inviting trick or treaters onto your property, then you don’t actually have legal grounds to convict someone for trespassing, unless you specifically told that individual to leave and they refused. You can of course press charges for theft, destruction of property, and public urination on a case by case basis, but I don’t think you have grounds for trespassing. I also wouldn’t advise trying to press charges for public intoxication since you don’t have breathalyzer results and therefore it’s impossible to prove intoxication. Just FYI in case you actually want to follow through with criminal charges. I’m not a lawyer though.",2023-10-29 00:17:40,7

comment,"I really can’t take this anymore, man",Idk what year you’re in but my first semester freshman year was absolutely atrocious for me for multiple reasons but to keep things short I ended my first semester with a 1.34 GPA I was put on academic probation and my parents wanted to send me home to community college. I was depressed and didn’t know what the future had for me. Now I still don’t know what the future has for me but I currently have a 2.7 GPA which I’m hoping to bring close to a 3.0 this semester. Things are going to be hard especially these next few semesters for you but the hard work is worth it. Before covid hit I was having the time of my life and doing well in school and I was at place I never thought was possible for me after my 1st semester freshman year. Switch majors if you have to do whatever it takes but keep working on yourself and school and things will get better. Edit: I am probably not the best person to help you but I can help guide you to resources JMU offers that has helped me and will probably help you too. JMU offers an academic counseling program for people put on academic probation that helps a lot and I strongly suggest joining.

Especially when during the course of them lawfully carrying out the search warrant they were fired upon resulting in them firing back in self defense. I agree it’s a tragedy. I agree the bureaucratic incompetence can not be allowed. But the officers serving the warrant did nothing wrong outside of the endangerment of how they used their weapons (ya know, what he was fired and charged for). There is witnesses that corroborate the police knocked (more like banged) the article even says the police were banging so loud the boyfriend thought it was a break in. The facts say she was not sleeping. The facts say it was a lawfully obtained search warrant. The facts say the police that’s served it carried it lawfully. The facts say the police were fired upon, even struck by a bullet.

comment,"Peaceful Protest tomorrow on campus! If you're still at JMU, please consider joining us for Breonna Taylor!","OK, I'm glad we can at least both agree that it's a tragedy. I's highly suspicious that police were not given body cameras for this operation but were given body cameras for previous operations. You need to keep in mind that trust in police is at an extremely low point in American history. I don't trust the police's word, they could've been arrested or faced much harsher penalties if things turned out being worse than they said. I have some faith in the witnesses, but it's hindered by the fact the police could threaten overt or legal violence against them and people would be justifying it with something like ""well the cops got caught for property damage caused during it, so it's fine."" Laws can literally be changed overnight so my issue isn't the legality of a problematic system that kills its own citizens regularly from it's own flaws, it's justice. When somebody's family gets millions of dollars for their member's wrongful death, maybe the death should be included in charges that the officer is guilty of.",2020-09-24 14:03:26,4

Call me crazy, but maybe a financial crime over a person the police were already staking out could've been handled in absolutely any other way. If the lawsuit they settled for is for wrongful death, and the city is now engaging in police reform, the city is implicitly (though they would never explicitly, because as you are right on, pr) saying they did something wrong. I think we agree on your last point a lot, because of this completely avoidable tragedy, the city ends up paying millions for a wrongful death, then even more preparing for all the riots they know they're going to cause with the verdict they're going to hand down, and then even more than that on the repairs and medical care that needs to be handled after the riots.

comment,513 active cases. Almost half of the quarantine beds full. We won’t be here another week.,"And if someone with terminal cancer dies after contracting covid, it would be counted as a covid death - when it should be counted as a cancer death. That’s actually happening. I know of someone in my hometown who OD’d on drugs, and they knew who the dealer was (my BIL is first responder and knows the person’s family) and the hospital was considering counting her as a covid death just because she tested positive after she CLEARLY died of an OD. And they were extremely worried about that happening because not only would it not be true, it would prevent them from having enough evidence to arrest the dealer since if they could count it as an OD death (which is was) they could pin her death on him and get him in jail for a good LONG time. That’s one reason why being *too* liberal with marking deaths as covid (when they clearly aren’t) is dangerous as well. Things need to be reported accurately. It’s okay to play it safe, but not to the extreme extent that it is right now because it affects other aspect of people’s lives as well. There has to be a balance, and it has to be based in facts, following proper guidelines - not the loose new national guidelines released several months back that allow for a death to be labeled as covid even if it’s not provable, at the discretion of the Doctor. That’s not how things are supposed to work (at least one health care worker has come out about the absurdity of the new guidelines in the media when they were sent out to doctors a while back) And that’s the problem with how things are being reported, because yes exactly, a cancer patient who dies of a heart attack was in reality killed by cancer. That’s the RIGHT way to determine a cause of death, and currently with covid, that’s not happening and it’s skewing the numbers. I think it was in NY that it came to light that 25% of their labeled “covid deaths” (like, saying that covid specifically was the cause of death) weren’t even TESTED for covid. And I’d be willing to bet that’s the same case across the country in light of the incredibly loose new national guidelines given to health care professionals. We need to be taking into account the LARGE margin of error (intentional or accidental) that is the reality of the pandemic right now, and make sure we’re checking the numbers ourselves, because we’re not being given all the facts 🤷🏽‍♀️",2020-09-01 16:50:31,0

I think truth be told no one knows what the true numbers are close to, and in that case i'd rather play it safe personally.

And yeah, I will say I do think the 6% no comorbidities/no compounding conditions that caused the covid death is very important, and it’s important to learn more about whether or not something like respiratory failure or cardiac arrest was actually a comorbidity (aka preexisting condition) or was simply caused by covid (in which case covid IS the cause of death) but I think the new statistic is cause for some hope at least!",2020-09-01 17:15:17,1

post,WOW... Who saw that coming......,"WOW... Who saw that coming...... Dear JMU community, We started this academic year in the midst of a pandemic that has disrupted all aspects of our lives. We spent the last several months planning to start this year with a mix of in-person, hybrid, and online classes. In the days since students have been back on campus, we have observed their vibrancy, excitement to engage with their faculty, and large-scale adherence to COVID-19 rules and guidance. However, we have also observed troubling public health trends. As a result of a rapid increase in the number of positive cases of COVID-19 in our student population in a short period of time, the university is concerned about capacity in the number of isolation and quarantine spaces we can provide. Protecting the health of our Harrisonburg and Rockingham County community—including students, faculty, staff—is our top priority, and we need to act swiftly to stop the spread as best we can. After consultation with the Virginia Department of Health, James Madison University will transition to primarily online learning, with some hybrid instruction for accreditation and licensure requirements, graduate research, and specialized upper-class courses requiring equipment and space, through the month of September. Courses currently offered online will continue to be online without any break in instruction. Classes will take place as scheduled for the remainder of this week unless students are otherwise notified by their faculty. In-person classes will transition online no later than this coming Monday, Sept. 7. Additionally, in an effort to reduce the number of people on campus, residents will be asked to return home by Sept. 7 unless they seek an [exemption to stay](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__emclick.imodules.com_ls_click-3Fupn-3Dw3rtLLOBBsx2UYJQqVZ7UmCgXCCRKQofc4YzU3mELwHu-2D2FeBnbjHGqLqZq9FCzabLYdi89eXH9ri66ZMMm-2D2FnP-2D2F3ZR3EalEuONPik63MAWMN9-2D2FQSaI2O-2D2B4Coq19qOh4l0u3MYx-5F7Hek-2D2B5s9AqzzKiBhnyVM1CoBLR2QEKSXEZeMppTdTHq-2D2F4odD1Noq-2D2BbOXtbn-2D2Bb5-2D2B32gTYpMX-2D2FqBw7unWMYtgT8YzYXcezi0sJXfWMzD-2D2Fwyw-2D2B7q5cxuw3guPO7hwDAnAFIDQyQ5aEH6TrJsmfc5c31J0ijl8Q5CRQ0D90EBwDffn4aPAdjlF-2D2BnlPRQ3iRODz7Kok8ACsF0g0XvPEf9cEGeDZCTewq7ZzgXP9tLCsUUtTlkwF-2D2BT-2D2BvmDaENreFLGRkbyFtBfDozJiAk6xgrbXBbPOSsuDhLinvl69A-2D2F0i4dnfb5eViombeBzxZNf1w36iySNNF-2D2FKFpuV6DP0w-2D2Fcomt0w0kd0DIsGd5qo0QJTCJ5pWTHaTbg0CNlnqIZi9uQ6i0inNy-2D2Fh3F-2D2FpwojIB9cH-2D2B-2D2FhsQcRdtMK-2D2FTdEpb5AdNUsLYwdjrvyt3cNMBD8eNY-2D2BecZ1NDU0P-2D2F2tS-2D2FG6PUSXqcciSevYRwEhvSS9Lb5f408aBZsWPeV15JJggZxkeE27DXctYbtZWWZbqrHTyXNIiP7AYUg-2D3D-2D3D&d=DwMFaQ&c=RWKzQL7PIkYKzsYSjZn54yrN72ooGPhHwUXdJ0S2Irw&r=CHoHWqqfhtMFgzNWMAUyarU2PZKWE18EvuYTdIKERNE&m=fb0mA9u60ht7D5eA_Xk_7BBPf2Ni2ZXW4WgauuXlqRc&s=dS-6wleMvp-fGDigQAFjALhfO-AlFIk7pwayTzBgpHg&e=). The Office of Residence life will be in touch with our on-campus residents within the next 24 hours with further details to ensure a smooth departure. **Over the next month, university officials will carefully monitor health trends and other developments, and will be in touch with the campus community by Sept. 25 regarding the possibility of returning to in-person instruction on or after October 5.** While courses will move primarily online during this four-week period, the university will remain open, and continue to offer on-campus amenities, such as dining, health and wellness services. Decisions about refunds have not yet been made, but we will communicate with students and families as soon as possible on that topic. We do not make this decision lightly, especially after all of the efforts on the part of so many people to make the campus environment safe for the return of in-person classes. All along, we understood that we might need to transition to online learning at any moment if circumstances required. Accordingly, our faculty used the summer months to prepare for various contingencies, and they are ready to deploy interactive, engaging and high-quality instruction in the virtual space. Also, the university has recently made significant investments in the technological infrastructure needed to support those efforts, such as acquiring a license with Zoom, a leading virtual meeting tool. To protect the health and safety of the communities to which students might be returning, students who have been advised to isolate or quarantine should finish out their prescribed time before leaving Harrisonburg. Additionally, as a precaution, students should plan to quarantine for two weeks upon arriving at their destination. This is a difficult message to deliver, and while it is made in the best interest of public health and safety, we know it will come as a disappointment to many. Others may appreciate this change to engage in online learning given the circumstances. As we planned our in-person reopening this fall, we carefully considered the strength of the relationships that make JMU so special, the interactions between each of us that create such a caring and unique environment. We will all make a concerted effort to maintain and enhance those interactions and to stay connected so we can emerge even stronger as a community that has weathered this unprecedented time together. In the meantime, our decisions will continue to be guided by public health and educational considerations at every turn. Working together in the finest spirit of JMU, I believe that Dukes can rise to meet this significant challenge. Warm regards, Jonathan R.

comment,omg guys pastor ray says gay rights!!! 😳😳😳🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈,"A lot of people are saying to just ignore him and while I kind of agree with that to an extent, I think that just ""ignoring the problem until it goes away"" kind if misses the point. People like him exist all around the country and they are going to keep doing everything in their power to strip the LGBTQ community of our rights. Some are just more powerful than others. The entire reason why protests exist is to show that we aren't going to stay quiet while people do this. Because the truth is that us shutting up and ignoring the bigotry IS what they want. They want us to let them get away with it so they can take it to the government, and god knows they've tried. You can do what you want but being a quiet minority has historically never ended well. Idk whether some of you are just apathetic to it or you're just straight and you think the loud gays are annoying but if we let the Brother Rays of the world keep preaching without consequence, people will start listening to what they have to say :/",2022-09-15 09:59:19,5
comment,omg guys pastor ray says gay rights!!! 😳😳😳🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈🏳️‍🌈,"I agree giving him attention definitely won’t get him to go away but I really don’t think ignoring him will get him to leave either. This guy is so staunch in his beliefs that he’d be out there one way or another. I think everyone protesting him is in essence just having a bit of fun while resisting the poisonous message he’s spewing. Nobody is going to get through to him, and it’s a little hard for his toxic message to reach people when it’s drowned out by clown music being played over a Bluetooth speaker. Its a perfect messy rejection of what he stands for. Like an internet argument it’s a one way conversation where the crowd spends the entire interaction dunking on him. This guy came onto a diverse campus of progressive young people and decided to spew sexist, racist, and homophobic rhetoric. I’m not at all opposed to people calling him out on his bullshit and making him a laughingstock.",2022-09-15 11:26:21,1

post,To RAs and undergrad HDs,"To RAs and undergrad HDs This text is primarily meant for current/previous undergrad Hall Directors and current/previous Resident Advisors who are/were employed by JMU. The situation that happened last night is frightening to us all. There was lots of talk about an RA that had been assaulted and it had brought all of us together in a way that I believe is very meaningful and powerful. If what I heard was true, then I am very sorry that it happened to this RA and I hope they understand that everbody has their back. If it didn't happen then we can use this to shine the light on the universities underwhelming pulls for being an RA, and we can also shine the light on the overwhelming responsibilities ORL, and the university expects of us. RAs are on the literal front line of everything that happens in the university. If someone is sick: they tell their RA, if someone is moving out; they tell their RA, if someone is having a bad day: they tell their RA, if someone is having a medical emergency: an RA is almost always the first one there. We are expected to be on the job for 24/7 in and out of the building, upholding the university standards and helping residents when they ask, or even if they didn't ask. Our sole purpose is not to get people in trouble, because lord knows just about all the RAs on campus have something that can get them fired. Our sole purpose is to be a resource to the residents of our respective halls, and make their lives and days just a little bit easier, unfortunately, if we do not get people in trouble for certain incidents then the blame will fall on us, and we must deal with the consequences of not fulfilling our job duties assigned in our contract. Many of us go above and beyond during our job, and that is actually frowned upon when it comes to our supervisors. Which is impossible to describe especially when your boss tells you this. That aside we must divulge into some of the facts of being an RA, we get ""paid"" 450 dollars a month as a first year RA. If we factor in the notion that ORL expects us to be an RA 24/7 that means we make about .61 cents an hour. This is absolutely ridiculous, making us the lowest paid university employee, with the most responsibility and least supervision. We also recieve a $100 dollar laundry stipend each semester, as well as $1000 off our room and board each semester. This may seem like a lot, and may seem like enough to offset college and have us living comfortably, but it is not. If we take a look at any given college in Virginia you will find that JMUs pay and benefits for RAs comes in dead last. The least they can do is give us free room and board, or free tuition. We are expected to mold the incoming students if we are in a freshman hall, or help transfer students adjust to a new and scary atmosphere for less than minimum wage. The goal of all of this it to shed some light on the situation. Students become RAs because they had a good experience with their RAs or feel like they can make a difference, and we are always making positive experiences and making a difference in our job. Though the added responsibilities of being what is essentially an in house pharmacist is just another cherry on top. All residence halls have been given a variety of medications that students can use, the RAs have little to no training on this medication, and the risk the university is putting on the RAs is great. This is something that is not even covered under the Good Samaritan act, because giving out medication is not in an RAs trained healthcare scope of practice. This means that if a resident was allergic to a medication that an RA gave, the RA is eligible to be sued by the parties effected. The entirety of the universities RA staff is greatful for the opportunities we have been given, and the opportunities that may come, but me and many others believe that a breaking point has been reached. We must fight for better benefits as a whole, especially when it seems that every year we get more and more responsibilities and less pay/recognition. Any comments on this are greatfully appreciative, supportful or not, all sides are welcome and a discussion must be had on this topic.

comment,To RAs and undergrad HDs,"as someone who was physically assaulted more than once and almost sexually assaulted while an RA on duty, I can say without a doubt that ORL does not care about its student employees whatsoever. when I inquired about pressing charges, I was flat-out told “this is what you signed up for” and was barred from pursuing charges.

After seeing what they when through, I swore off being an RA as I saw them be taken advantage of in those positions. Really with the minimum wage increases, the university needs to make benefit increases across the board. One of the reasons we are still short staffed after the year hiring freeze on all levels is because they aren't offering jobs at competitive rates. As someone who has been routinely involved in hiring searches on campus, there isn't a labor shortage.

comment,To RAs and undergrad HDs,"I'm looking at the compensation package, all inclusive, and that's pathetic. I was a first-year RA in 2001-2002, and we got paid $405 per month, or $4050 per year. There were no laundry or housing stipends that came with it. Adjusted for inflation, that's $6361.40 in today's dollars. With the stipends, the total compensation for RAs comes to $6700 per year, but when you deduct the stipends, you're only making $4500 a year, which means that JMU RAs are compensated even more poorly than they were in my day (and that pay was considered low then). The housing stipend in particular bothers me, because the RA doesn't really see that, but rather, that benefits the parents' bottom line. > We must fight for better benefits as a whole, especially when it seems that every year we get more and more responsibilities and less pay/recognition. Good luck with that, especially since state employees are not allowed to collectively bargain in Virginia. The deck is stacked in favor of your employer, and unfortunately, there is nothing that you can do about that. About the only thing that you can do is choose not to participate. > Many of us go above and beyond during our job, and that is actually frowned upon when it comes to our supervisors. I've learned from many years in the workplace that it does not pay to go above and beyond, and may actually harm you. Only give your boss what they are paying for, and no more.

comment,To RAs and undergrad HDs,"I was an RA for fall and spring 2017-2019 and later worked in SLI senior year (which was short lived, different story) and all I wanna say is: ORL exploits students. They brainwash you into thinking you’ll be doing amazing work to give back to JMU and even though sometimes you are, there’s still a bad reputation of the job itself from ignorant students (therefore disrespect), overwhelming situations that we have to deal with, 24/7 work as OP mentioned, and to top it off: being underpaid. They’re slowly adding benefits every year but it doesn’t seem like it’s making the work any easier or bearable especially considering the recent SA situation (sadly not the first time, btw).

I have heard all too much of things along these lines happening to people, while I myself, a male RA have had residents do unprovoked sexual advances, and there is nothing pro-staff will do about this.

comment,To RAs and undergrad HDs,"The group of us that are actually getting this going have looked into this. I want to directly respond to some of this stuff but idk how to use reddit lmao. The plan of this is that if we get enough RAs and HDs on our side we will be able to pursue a potentially better atmosphere along with better pay and benefits. Unfortunately, this may come with some rough roads as collective bargaining is not a thing in Virginia, but we can take in mind that JMU does receive federal funds, so it does put us in a grey area. It is not the intention for us to be a pain in the ass, but as I speak I already have multiple buildings entire staff in contact with me and on board with this. RAs are so short-staffed that they cannot afford to fire multiple buildings staff, so maybe a week or two without RAs doing duty just might be the thing that needs to happen, or maybe something else less radical. I don't want you to see me in a strange light here, I am more or less a figurehead of this who is just giving out information, there are others who are planning things and offers to give to ORL on our behalf, and we are also in contact with local news and of course, the breeze. The higher level of performance was more like this ""I have seen you in so many community reports from other RAs, and you have written so many community reports, so stop it. The other RAs need to learn how to be independent and not call someone when they can't figure something out, so stop helping everyone.""

When roommate conflicts start to emerge, or resident mental health takes a downfall, and you have a legitimate risk of a resident committing suicide on your floor that you cannot do anything about.

I am sure you can see where this is going but this is happening more and more in every building.

comment,To RAs and undergrad HDs,"As much as I appreciate your efforts in this way, you are going to get nowhere on this. Unions are still banned for state employees, which residence life employees fall under as JMU is a state agency.

You probably won't get anything accomplished in time to directly benefit the current group of resident advisors, but you hopefully can lay some groundwork for those that come behind you. Without getting a legal framework in place, you can't form a union, and by pursuing this while collective bargaining by state employees is illegal, you are walking anyone that follows you directly off of a cliff. If employees try to form a union right now, they will simply be fired.",2022-02-02 03:24:06,0

If they do a mass firing of us for us simply just trying to come together and ask for wages comparable to other employers it probably won't go well. JMU is hurting for RAs, hurting so bad that the RAs that stayed until December of this year got a 500 dollar bonus from the paychecks of the RAs that are missing. If the university even attempted to come at us they would lose 3 buildings, and one of them has the most staff on the entire campus.",2022-02-02 06:40:50,3

Please share it so it gains traction!","Here's the reasoning that I put in the petition: ""In these strenuous times of uncertainty following the coronavirus outbreak and academic changes, appropriate action should be taken to ensure students do not underperform due to outside pressures that are no fault of their own. Giving students an option to make their classes pass-fail would allow students to still succeed in this online learning environment, while not sacrificing the hard work we have put earlier into this semester, along with the hard work we have put into our GPAs from previous semesters. For many future jobs and internship opportunities, student GPAs are one of the strongest indicators for performance and qualification. Having a semester where everyone is set back in their academic performance will only hurt us in our future prospects. Many people, students and professors included, are not acclimated to an online learning environment. Along with that, many classes simply are not ideal for this mode of instruction. While professors can try to shift their classes to the best of their ability to make online learning work, it will never be to the same effect as the face to face instruction many of us are used to. When we paid for our tuition, we students had a specific idea for how we wanted to be taught. Some students may feel as though online instruction might benefit them while others have no idea how their classes could even be feasible online. Giving us the option to decide how we want these classes to affect our futures is the only reasonable idea and I urge you to give great consideration to this moving forward.""",2020-03-18 12:21:51,13

Please share it so it gains traction!","Going thru the reasons people have been giving on the petition, I think you are underestimating the severity of the issue. Some people have harsh home lives and family members in quarantine. Some people have learning disabilities and attention disorders which makes non-face to face learning much, much harder on them. So to put the stresses of an unfamiliar mode of instruction on top of that, while being expected to perform already hard coursework at the same level in which we were performing previously is just ridiculous. I realize this idea is a bit foreign, but this entire situation is foreign to everyone. You can't compare having to do weekend labs temporarily to having your entire semester flipped on its head. Other top schools around the country have already adopted this system. You would still have to pass your classes, you would still be learning the material, and you would still have the option of retaining whichever grade you get. Remember, grades not only affect students but professors as well. They should not be viewed negatively for having to teach in a manner they are unfamiliar with. Online classes are not a new thing, but online classes that were not meant to be online taught by professors who have never taught online are.",2020-03-18 21:19:58,1

comment,sex offender harassing women downtown and has a history of telling women at GMU that he's in a fraternity in order to lure them into his car/apartment,Something feels wrong about his registration. The data seems to be inconsistent. I can't look into this now but if anyone knows how to report data issues on the sex offender register please look into it. The thing that got my attention is that his work address is in a different state and I find it hard to believe a violent offender could get a remote job. Also he has received multiple charges for not updating his registration. For real I suspect he should be in a prison since there is a very good chance he is intentionally doctoring his registration so he could possibly reoffend.,2020-03-06 11:57:52,8

post,Parking and parking services at jmu needs revision,Parking and parking services at jmu needs revision I cannot be the only one here that feels this way. We pay $300 dollars on top of our tuition just to be able to ATTEND the classes we already pay for. With that the parking is so limited and congested that the $300 always feels like a waste. I try not to even waste my time driving to main campus because I assume I won’t be able to find a spot.

So by making them pay more you’re going to be hurting those students such as myself that already have a hard time coming to school here because of the cost. I can’t afford an apartment or to live on campus because it’s much cheaper for me to drive to school.

post,Why JMU Students Should Get Vaccinated,"Why JMU Students Should Get Vaccinated I'm a senior at JMU and just wanted to share with everyone why you should get vaccinated. First, many of us have had at least a year, if not a couple years, without being on campus and/or seeing friends from JMU. I want a normal semester without masks and restrictions not just for me but for everyone on campus. I want to see friends and not have to have virtual classes or wear a mask because there's some covid outbreak on campus. We all have different views on the pandemic. I know some people are against mandatory vaccination. I didn't think it was right to do it a few months ago and that it's better to just convince people. Vaccines have been required in schools for a long time - this is literally nothing new. However, employers do clearly have the legal ability to require employers are vaccinated. George Washington required troops to be vaccinated during the Revolution because smallpox was ravaging the troops. Why can't employers do the same today? The Pfizer and Moderna vaccines are safe and they are effective. The vaccines have been tested over and over again and millions across the country have had them. I had the Pfizer and the worst thing that happened was my arm was sore. The vaccines dramatically reduce your chance of being infected. Even if you get it, you are more than likely to have a mild case. The delta variant wouldn't have ravaged the country if more people were vaccinated. Of course not everyone here or globally ever will be but we can make it like the flu and prevent hospitals from being overrun. We can prevent the rolling restrictions and mandates we are seeing but only if more of us get vaccinated The way out of this pandemic from the beginning was always vaccination. Masks won't end the pandemic, social distancing and restrictions won't end it - only vaccines will. All those other things only by you time until you have a vaccine - which we have now. The more people that are vaccinated, the less chance the virus has to mutate and the quicker we can make yearly booster shots like we do for the flu. All viruses mutate - that is correct - but why would anyone want to get tested for this virus and have a swab up your nose every time you travel or get infected multiple times when you could just get vaccinated and dramatically reduce your risk and others. Why would you want to be tested each week for covid when you can just get vaccinated? Obviously I can't tell anyone here what to do but I highly recommend you get vaccinated. I didn't think I'm at high risk but I didn't want to risk being in a hospital or giving it to my parents. I don't want to go back to wearing a mask - I've been vaccinated but many (about half in the country) haven't been. The more people vaccinated, the less risk to you guys and our health system I don't believe that vaccinations should be required post pandemic to go to a restaurant or fly but I do think it's a great way to get more people vaccinated. The vaccines are how we put the pandemic behind us. **This isn't about eradicating covid or ending covid cases - it's about making the vast majority of cases mild so we can manage the pandemic** Even if you don't think covid will hit you bad or your family, what's the harm in getting it? Why wait until you get infected and potentially end up in the hospital? I'm not saying you will just that the vaccines are extremely effective. Yes, some vaccinated people that get infected can transmit the virus but no vaccine is 100% effective and the vast, vast majority of cases and hospitalizations are unvaccinated people across the country Just get vaccinated, it's not that hard and you can walk up pretty much anywhere today and get vaccinated. It's seriously not that big of an inconvenience and it's not that hard. Protect yourself, your friends, family, and others across the country For Reference: The Long History of Mandated Vaccines in the United States https://www.governing.com/now/the-long-history-of-mandated-vaccines-in-the-united-states See AP Article: EXPLAINER: Employers have legal right to mandate COVID shots US Supreme Court: Jacobson v.

comment,Why JMU Students Should Get Vaccinated,"And as more people get vaccinated, the less likely the virus is to spread which means less chance of mutation. Every time the virus moves to a new person, there’s a chance that a mutation can happen. Enough mutations in a strain of the virus and you have a new variant. If the virus keeps mutating and getting more variants, the more likely the vaccines will be less effective at combating COVID. Getting vaccinated is super important to slowing down this virus.",2021-08-08 22:01:19,18

comment,Why JMU Students Should Get Vaccinated,"Unpopular opinion: Can we just leave people alone? Please? You said it yourself, 50.7% of the country is vaccinated, and that is continuing to grow. We are at a point with covid that those who are vaccinated are protected and those who are not are on their own. I’ve said in previous posts that people over the age of 12 years old have had every opportunity, and still do, to get the vaccine. At this point, those who have gotten it have made their decision, and those who haven’t have made theirs. If they get sick, they’re on their own. If they get hospitalized, they’re on their own. If they die, God forbid, they are on their own. And I continuously get comments, messages, and responses saying “what about everyone off campus??” Same rule applies: you’ve had the opportunity, and you’ve made your decision. One thing said in your post here is that if we get vaccinated we can stop the masking and go back to normal. While Virginia is an outlier at the moment, the federal government and CDC are saying otherwise...to mask whether vaccinated or not. That’s what’s happening with K-12 schools right now. A bunch of school systems are masking students and teachers REGARDLESS of vaccination status. According to the CDC’s data, K-12 aged folks (0-17) make up only 349 of all of the covid deaths. To put that into a percentage perspective, that’s 0.057% of all deaths. For college age folks (18-29), the number is 2,519 deaths from covid, percentage is 0.408%...not even half of a percent of the deaths. Thus, I see it as a choice. Get vaccinated or don’t. If one way makes you feel safer than the other, so be it.",2021-08-09 15:55:59,-8

comment,Why JMU Students Should Get Vaccinated,"Unfortunately, I don't think we're going to have a ""normal"" year regardless of the vaccination status of the student body. The daily case count is way higher (57k August 6 2020 vs 170k August 6 2021) than it was this same time last year, and the deaths are rising again.

Also, considering I was *in* my apartment when the fire actually started, I have just a bit of anger and resentment towards the person(s) that could’ve killed me or anyone else that had to evacuate in such a small window of time.

comment,Fire officials release cause of apartment fire in Harrisonburg (smoking),Punishment fine? That person caused millions in damage to the structure and destroyed the belongings of up to 48 people. I don't think a fine is going to cut it. I think arson charges might be inorder. I hope they find who did it and I also hope that person has enough liability insurance to cover the damage they caused to those residents lives. I also hope that Southview has some responsibility put on them for negligence.

I knew I had to evacuate the building when I heard loud banging on my door, smelled smoke and saw nothing but clouds of smoke through the glass door where my balcony was supposed to be.

comment,Fire officials release cause of apartment fire in Harrisonburg (smoking),"Arson is done intentionally so arson is off the table as any form of punishment. As far as figuring out who did it would be harder. You could go through every apartment and asks who smokes but most people will just say no to avoid the punishment. And you could only narrow it down to about 12 people max and possibly go from there. The fire alarms didn’t go off because the fire climbed the outside of the building first, where there are no fire alarms. I lived in 1083B and had basically all my stuff in there so I have to rebuy everything and I’m just annoyed by that because things are able to be rebought. Memories aren’t. I had a decade and a half worth of my history in my apartment which is all gone now due to the negligence. So I feel you.

comment,Fire officials release cause of apartment fire in Harrisonburg (smoking),"> You could go through every apartment and asks who smokes but most people will just say no to avoid the punishment. > I hope the person responsible would come forward, but I don’t see that happening Your analysis seems reasonable. I would be very surprised if the person whose smoking materials caused the fire ever came forward. It doesn't benefit them to do so in any way. Talk about being a marked person after that, if everyone knew that you were the one who burned a whole bunch of people out of their houses. Back when I was a student, we also never found out who caused the fires at the Commons or Hunter Ridge, both also caused by careless smoking. Also, depending on the number of smokers in the building and what they did after they finished, it's very possible that the person who started it doesn't even know that they're the one who started it. Mulch tends to smolder for a while, so there could have been a long interval between the act and the big fire.",2019-03-30 12:52:16,3

I don't know too much about it but I see it now and again and it always looks different. A couple weeks ago, while classes were finishing up, it was painted as the worlds largest crack rock, /u/Colonelshat posted this [gem](http://www.reddit.com/r/jmu/comments/24ie9q/sources_say_that_after_stepping_down_from_office/). It was painted again during the graduation ceremonies but as I was biking around Harrisonburg the other day I went through JMU and noticed that 'the crack is back'.",2014-05-26 19:16:33,3

post,"Alums or even current Dukes, remember hypnotist scandal?","Alums or even current Dukes, remember hypnotist scandal? As a JMU alum for what will be two years now, my four years at JMU each had specific, weird and sometimes bad things happen each year (Southview apartment fire, COVID, explosion, multiple suicides/Bridgewater shooting in one week, etc…). Going through this thread, I had totally forgotten about the hypnotist scandal that happened in 2019 (I was a sophomore and not a FROG, so I didn’t go). I’ve always been curious about what exactly happened and people’s experiences with it (since JMU pretty much covered it up and barred people from speaking about it). Since it will be almost five years since it happened (wow that makes me feel old), is anyone willing to share their experience if they were there? I just find it so odd that something like this happened and no one really ever talks about it on here….",2024-01-19 16:50:12,64
comment,"Alums or even current Dukes, remember hypnotist scandal?","Oh yeah, I went to that event. I was a freshman and went with 5 other ppl. We got to the auditorium place and took our seats and the guy started talking. He was talking about hypnotizing the whole audience, and basically saying get out of your seat if you want to be hypnotized or something like that. Me and my one other friend were like uh no we will just watch so we didn’t do whatever he asked us to do. Other 3 people I’m with decide to do it. Basically starts this hypnosis speech and I was just looking around observing the crowd. Eventually we start hearing people like screaming and crying, it was so obscure. My friend looked at me like wtf, and I was looked at him with the same reaction. I remember looking at the guy and he looked panicked, and he starts trying to stop the hypnosis. He would say one word like “stop” or “break” or something but people were still freaking out. Then they started calling ambulances n shit and trying to stop the event, it was chaos getting out. I could tell the staff were freaking out and so surprised at what just happened. Luckily, my 3 friends who participated were fine and just said they felt like they were in a trance for a while. That whole night everyone on our floor was just really shocked at what just happened and kinda processing it. Felt rly bad for the people who had a bad experience there. Also was just mad confused as someone who didn’t really take hypnosis seriously.",2024-01-19 19:18:32,43

comment,"Alums or even current Dukes, remember hypnotist scandal?","I’m an older alum (1978), and my roommate and I attended a hypnotist’s performance in ‘77. My roommate decided to try to go under during the whole audience demo and was one of the 12 or so chosen to go on stage. They swear they weren’t faking and I knew them well enough to agree they were definitely affected somehow, not acting. It was a hilarious experience, fascinating to say the least. One of the hypnotist’s final suggestions to the folks on stage was that they would feel tremendously rested and positive, and that in the future whenever they heard about a scheduled hypnotist’s performance, they would feel compelled to go unless there was a conflict like studying or being sick. Fast forward to the following year. My (same) roommate and I planned a vegetative evening of smoking weed and watching Jim and Tammy Bakker’s new PTL club talk show (hysterical), and I mentioned that the same hypnotist was on campus that evening — I hadn’t finished saying it before my roommate was putting on shoes and coat, saying, “Let’s go!” And when I looked puzzled because of our earlier couch-potato plans, they blinked as if clearing their head and said their urge to attend was totally automatic, a surprise to them as well. Of course we went, and the show was as fun as the previous year but this time my roommate stayed in the audience as an observer.",2024-01-20 16:38:09,6

There is a small one-person bathroom in that hall. Leeolou Alumni Center-- this is the best one.

From the article; “Colleges and universities like JMU are making monumental decisions impacting the lives and pocketbooks of thousands of students and families,” said Rhyne. “Not giving them the tools to monitor and participate in these decisions, when the technology is easily accessible and harnessed, disregards their interests and concerns.”",2020-09-13 14:26:24,26

post,campus closing,"campus closing Honestly, are y’all actually surprised this happened? I thought it was pretty inevitable considering all of the other colleges this has happened to. Idk if y’all have been on campus recently but there is NO social distancing. I had to wait to get food on campus for over 45 mins the other night because of how many people there were. Everyone LOOOVEEES to blame off campus parties/gatherings for the rise in cases (which this is part of it) but what did you expect by bringing 20,000+ people back to campus without even being tested and then holding IN-PERSON classes?? That right there should have been a red flag to students. Most people probably already had it before even coming to campus and brought it with them. When it comes down to it, jmu is a business. I know everyone likes to think that they have a ton of money, but I know they are definitely financially struggling from this pandemic. This need for money has caused jmu to make very poor decisions.

Brilliant!",2020-09-02 11:38:50,7
comment,campus closing,"first of all, how can you tell where covid is being traced from? how can ANYONE tell where someone got it from? you can’t, you can just make an educated guess. Just because you were in contact with someone who has it and you got it, doesn’t mean you necessarily got it from them. If a student is going to IN-PERSON classes they are around so many people in both class and on campus. The only real way to trace where someone could have gotten it from would be to completely isolate everyone from the start and only allow them to have one person to visit them. Then, you could narrow it down to that individual that was in contact with them :) And your saying “when the rates continue to rise in Harrisonburg” etc. etc. the rates will continue to rise because we are in a pandemic. So many people from all over the U.S. just came to Harrisonburg for college and now they have to move out, bringing even MORE people. Of COURSE we will continue to rise after campus closes because it’s too late. There’s already been too much exposure. I also never said that I don’t blame students who choose to party (they still are a big part of the problem) the problem is that there were so many students who came to campus already having covid.",2020-09-02 11:22:10,4

Basically it's all of the good parts of college, but no classes for a week. It's the coolest thing because you're doing fun stuff all day and walking around campus and eating at the dining hall with your new friends and stuff. You'll get tired of walking all day and not want to go to some events, but GO. TO. EVERYTHING. You'll regret it if you don't. Be careful going to parties during Frog Week. I know a couple people that got strikes because they didn't really know the way to do things. I'm not saying don't go, just don't be dumb. Some highlights from my Frog Week? Hmmm. At the block party at the end of the week, some girls invited me and my roommate back to their dorm in Skyline, and we were so excited. We were like ""Fuck yeah, college is awesome!"", then we ended up watching Princess Frog and listened to a guy talk about his comic book for an hour and we left. ""Airport"" was my shit.

For me I came in with my Associates in General Studies, and I had no courses outside of my major to take, but of all the things I had available, I still had 4 extra credits I needed to take to be a full time student. So my thing is I picked up a minor in CIS so I could add on a few extra credits to my semester, especially something that would be beneficial, because you also need to take at least 60 credits at JMU before you can graduate. My personal major is CS, so I don't know how the pre-requisite criteria is for your major, but I was very limited with what classes I could actually enroll in right when I got here.

Cops won't bother you as long as you aren't stumbling around, in the street, or carrying something. Honestly, it's hard to a get a strike unless you're being stupid. I've been out and about blacked out, super drunk and never had problems. Just stay with good, well behaved people, and be a well behaved person. If you have a friend that is sick, like really sick, call an ambulance. As long as the ambulance is on the way, you're completely free of any trouble.

post,Food waste. I’m tired of this.,"Food waste. I’m tired of this. I’m tired of seeing students throw away almost uneaten food at the dining halls. As a student employee, it hurts me to see that people are throwing almost uneaten sandwiches and plates of uneaten food. This could be due to students not hungry, portion size control, or the fact that they just don’t like the food. But it bothers me that what students throw away in the dish return could’ve been food for someone else. The main places I’m seeing thrown away food are from the sandwich station (Upper Crust) as well as the chicken tender station (Hen & Harvest). I have served many people at both stations and can say that I’ve seen students that already have food in their hands from another station while they are in the serving line. Now, if someone throws away, for example, an uneaten pizza crust or sandwich crust, that’s normal. I do the same especially if it’s very dry. The foods that really worry me are the proteins, which are more expensive and have a bigger ethical and environmental impact. Some solutions I have are to: 1. Only take as much as you can eat ***in the moment*** or ***in one sitting***. Consider waiting a few minutes before you go back for seconds and let your body decide, “Hey, do you really want to get more food? I might not be hungry anymore.” 2. Have the employees keep the portion sizes regular. I will address this to my team. 3. Choose your favorite station. Try to stick to one or two stations that you like the most and stick to those. If you eat at your favorite station, you are more likely to finish your food rather than waste it. Of course, food waste is not going to be completely eliminated, but taking steps like this can be a good approach to reducing waste.",2023-11-01 15:42:04,61

IF YOU EVER FEEL IN DANGER OR UNCOMFORTABLE PLEASE TELL US, we will take care of the situation. we want everyone to feel welcome in our bars so if a person is being creepy or phobic then let us know. thank you guys ❤️ hope this helps someone and y'all rule -secret townie bartender",2023-03-26 04:36:52,60

comment,Ordering Starship around Valentine’s (mini warning/embarrassing),OMG there is an idea that my friends and i have really wanted to get to whoever is in charge of the starships - we think it would be really funny if the boys barked like dogs. we all see them as little stray puppies that just go around campus. every time we see one we pet it and we talk to them like they’re dogs. please consider putting in a barking option. it would mean the world to me and my friends to see one bark.,2021-02-12 22:30:28,3

post,“Just take a semester off!”,"“Just take a semester off!” Not a JMU student, but I almost went here, and my brother goes here, so I’ve been keeping an eye on how JMU is handing the situation. I feel bad for y’all, JMU is doing worse than any other VA college right now. Some people have been saying “If you’re worried, just take a semester off!”. Most people can’t do this for multiple reasons: 1. Student loans go into repayment after 6 months, and not everyone has the money to put down payments on that. 2. Some people are using student loans and refunds to pay for housing and food, and if they take a semester off they can’t get that. 3. I assume the majority of y’all wanna graduate as soon as possible so you can get a job 4. Taking a gap semester is risky, and it can turn into not going back again 5. A lot of people don’t have the best home life, and if they have to go back home for a semester, it can be horrible for mental health JMU should never have sent you all back, it should have been virtual from the start. All of you definitely know how bad it is to party right now, but some of you are choosing to ignore that and party anyways, and that’s horrible.

Also, you're going to find a positive correlation on campus with educational attainment and likelihood of wearing a mask. It's not a perfect correlation, but it is definitely a strong one. That being said, it also depends on what the education is in. Certain disciplines will be more inclined to value to science behind the recommendations than others. I work in an area where the degrees are more from a discipline that doesn't value these things as much, which is why even those with more education than me aren't following the guidance. I'd be willing to bet that the faculty, staff, and students in the academic department that matches up with their background probably have a lower level of adherence to the guidelines than, say, biology.",2020-08-13 09:22:50,3

post,How to be helpful while ICE is around town,"How to be helpful while ICE is around town There are lots of rumors this week about ICE activity in and around Harrisonburg. Very little has been confirmed. If you're interested in being helpful to the undocumented community, here are some tips: 1. If you see an enforcement event, video record it. Note how many officers, from what agencies, and note the location, date, and time of day. Note the participation of any local law enforcement. Try to respect the privacy of people being detained as much as possible, but share that recording with allies (along with key info). If ICE is no longer at the site when you share the recording, say that too (it's helpful to know when an event is finished). 2. Drive by the local ICE office (at 282 Neff Ave next to Comfort Inn and Suites behind the mall) and look for unusual activity. If you see marked vehicles (from federal law enforcement or local police) it's a pretty good sign something might be going down. Record if possible. Alert allies with factual details about how many, what markings, and if there is any visible movement. 3. Do not spread rumors. If you see or hear a rumor, go to the site where it's supposed to be happening and check it out. Get key facts and recordings to share out. People still need to work, shop, and go to school and fear based on false rumors hurts those who feel they have to hide out as well as our community overall. 4. Donate to local immigrant-serving organizations like NewBridges and Church World Service.

comment,Pain.,"As a prof, I will say that Canvas tests blow. There are about 20 different permutations to a fill-in-the-blank answer that I will accept and I often forget the one or two that my students will put in there. It's just as frustrating for us. It's why I've started doing the ""essay"" question for any fill-in-the-blank. If I have to regrade the shit anyway, I may as well do it so the student KNOWS it will be re-graded and not have a heart attack thinking they got an answer wrong that is in fact correct.",2021-02-26 08:13:56,9
comment,Pain.,"One more thing - I just found this out. On Canvas in the grader section, there is a ""Grade Posting Policy"" where the prof can set grading to manual.

It saves a headache for the student and angry emails for the professor.",2021-02-26 11:32:35,1

Virginia Community Colleges and a shit ton of other systems still use it because they don’t want to pay the cost of moving to a Cloud offering. I think Oracle has one but people are slow to move. If Oracle has their way they’d move everyone to cloud. Regardless those services are in the millions of dollars and are ridiculously complicated.

Does JMU know it's old and painful and people hate it? Absolutely. Does it do exactly the job it needs to do, enough to mean it's not a priority each year in the budget? Yes. Does it also suck terribly for Oracle? Definitely. For even deeper reasons than you wanting to use modern software, they would LOVE to only have to support modern software.",2020-04-06 10:33:46,10

Why does the University need to tell you what to do to remain safe? You as an individual are responsible for your own actions and behaviors. If you need to modify your mode of transportation(walking/biking instead of using the bus) or find a less trafficked route to and from buildings then that's what you need to do.

post,In:re the last post on this sub– if you want to take action instead of just signing a petition,"In:re the last post on this sub– if you want to take action instead of just signing a petition 1) The SGA is writing bills to formally petition the university to change the names of the three buildings named after members of the Confederate States of America: Jackson, Ashby, and Maury. As of earlier this week, that bill of opinion was made public to the JMU community and it will be voted on during a special session this summer. Support this bill in calls, letters, emails, etc. with administration. 2) I am developing a working group in conjunction with many members of the former Task Force for Inclusion that made its recommendations to the university last year. If you are interested in making the campus a more welcoming place for Black students, especially by way of building name changes, please contact me. 3) We have a number of organizations in the Harrisonburg area that specifically work to help our Black community. They include the Shenandoah Valley Black Heritage Project (of which I am on the board), our chapter of the NAACP, and the Furious Flower Poetry Center. Donate your time and money to these organizations and you will see meaningful change in your community. 4) Take a class in the African, African American, and Diaspora Studies department. There’s probably a class in your major or minor that’s also in this department because it’s interdisciplinary. Use this as an opportunity to educate yourself and keep an open mind about different ways people see the world. Finally, remember that even if you never made the connection that Jackson Hall is named for Stonewall Jackson, that doesn’t mean other students or prospective students didn’t. More than anything, building names are mnemonics that honor certain values represented by a person. I believe that those values espoused by the eponymous figures of our buildings ought to represent the values of the university. Yes, there is a line where we stop considering certain actions or beliefs a “flaw” or a “product of their time.” We do not know exactly where that line falls for every person commemorated by a building name or the name of the university itself, but we must look toward a critical evaluation of that line and meet its demands. This is not a matter of “wiping away history”– we teach history all over our campus, and it is accesible through so many platforms. These buildings did not originally have these names– they were changed as a result of the Lost Cause movement, the likes of which also inspired a resurgence of the KKK. Changing these building names and working toward the inclusion of Black students is not a political issue– it is a moral one. It is our moral imperative.

You can use this to look at reviews and get advice on courses you're interested in, as well as filter courses by department and level and compare these courses. You can also sort courses by difficulty, usefulness and the overall rating from reviews made by other students. I think if enough people start using it regularly. it's going to be essential when you're choosing your electives or just to get advice on courses you will be taking and know what to expect. Please let me know if there is anything that I should change or what features I should add. Lastly, filtering and sorting courses is only gonna be useful and accurate if there are a lot of reviews, so please go ahead and leave some reviews to courses you've taken or are currently taking.

comment,I made ratemyprofessors but for classes: Rate My Courses,OK I understand what your idea is here and what the goal of the website is supposed to accomplish but I think you might be overlooking some things. For many and I would dare say most courses the difficulty and content depends on the professor so comparing for instance Spanish 232 with Javier is completely different than any other Spanish class because he gives you way more opportunities to succeed and makes the class way easier. Rate my professor already shows you per review what class they took when they gave it. I’m not saying that your website is useless but I think you need to find something that makes it stand out and accomplish something that can’t already be accomplished by rate my professor because as much as it says rate my professor at already accomplishes the rate by class with their functions.,2021-11-17 10:00:45,13

post,Tips/Advice for any new/returning Dukes for the Fall,"Tips/Advice for any new/returning Dukes for the Fall As an alumna and current employee at JMU who works with students and their academic planning often, let me give some advice to all the incoming freshmen (and any upper classmen) to make college a little less stressful: &#x200B; * **Check your emails**. I really can't stress this enough. While classes are in session, I recommend checking them multiple times every day and at least every three days or so while you're on break. I can't tell you how many students create unnecessary stress for themselves because they didn't check their emails regularly and then have to scramble to get things together. This goes for Canvas too. * **Interlibrary Loan (ILL) is hella good and should be used if you're broke and can't afford books.** The libraries are a great way to save some money on textbooks. Check them to see if a textbook you need is there, and if it's not, you can use ILL. It basically asks other colleges if they have the book you're looking for, and then they send it to you if they do. For free. I never paid for another textbook after my sophomore year because I used ILL. Keep in mind, there are some stipulations (textbook takes time to get to the university, might already be checked out, etc.), so the sooner you jump on it, the less trouble you'll have. You can find it [here](https://www.lib.jmu.edu/) at the bottom of the page under ""Services & Spaces."" * **The Counseling Center is FREE.** If you're struggling with your mental health, the Counseling Center in the Student Success Center is an amazing addition to JMU and has some fantastic people in there. They have different types of programs you can join, all of which are free (technically, your tuition already paid for it, so you might as well take advantage of it while you're here). The Studio and Oasis are little self-care spaces that students can go into and do all kinds of things (paint, color, relax in a massage chair, etc.). They also have dogs for animal therapy! If you find yourself having a hard time, I *highly* recommend you take a moment to just pop in and check it out (shoutout to Kara Karr for being the best person while I was a student here). * **If you plan on going out and partying, be safe and be smart.** It's just a fact that some students are going to go out and have a good time, so telling them to not do something is just going to make them do the opposite. On the back of every JACard are numbers that you have access to if you ever find yourself in a situation where you need them. SafeRides is a FREE and non-judgmental ride back to your home, and they even have an app now iirc. If you're underaged and have engaged in a few activities that may or may not be in your best interest legally speaking, SafeRides will get you home without asking any questions. It's better to call them to bring you home while you're intoxicated than the Harrisonburg Police. * **Email your professors if you're struggling in a class.** It happens. Sometimes life comes around and kicks you in the a\*\*, and you'll find yourself missing classes or assignments. Reach out to your professors and be honest with them. Surprisingly enough, most professors don't actually want to see their students fail, and many of them might be able to work something out with you depending on when you reach out. Mind you, this isn't for every professor; some of them will stick to their guns and you'll be SOL, but a good chunk of them will try. College can be challenging and professors know that. Reach out when you notice yourself starting to get bad. * **If you can, avoid 8am classes like the plague.** Trust me, trust me, trust me. You'll try and trick yourself into thinking you'll be able to do it since you did it in high school, and sure, maybe for the first half of the semester you will. But I promise you, some of those classes will whoop your a\*\* more than any 400 level class will. If you have to take one (because you're a freshman and get the leftover pickings of enrollment), wear something comfortable, bring something caffeinated, bring gum/mints if your prof is chill with it, and sit in the front as often as possible. You're more likely to pay attention and focus if you do. These are just a few bits of advice I can toss to anyone, and obviously each person is going to have a different experience. If you want more secrets or resources offered by JMU (tutoring, enrollment, studying tips, etc.), my chats are always open, and I can give you my office location/email if you need it. Good luck Dukes! I hope the semester/year goes well for you! **✌️**",2021-07-26 13:22:42,56
comment,Tips/Advice for any new/returning Dukes for the Fall,"Great advice. I would also add READ THE SYLLABUS. 9 times out of 10 the question you have is answered there. Read all of your syllabi and make a schedule/calendar of tests, quizzes, due dates, and anything else important. Get organized first, it saves you so much trouble! Also, if you are unclear on material, go to your professor’s office hours! I was confused on a subject and my prof pulled three different books of her shelf and broke it down until it clicked. I found that most (not all) are very willing to help, but you need to ask for it. You can always find the office hours listed in (you guessed it!) the syllabus.",2021-07-26 19:27:47,19

comment,Tips/Advice for any new/returning Dukes for the Fall,"Welcome to JMU! Sometimes, the 8ams are unavoidable especially as a freshman. I personally never biked around campus, but I know it is a much more efficient way to get around, especially if you're in a rush. The bus system works well, however, I know that they can get backed up from time to time meaning you run the risk of being late to class. If you can and are comfortable with it, I recommend the bike.

On days where I caught the bus, it was honestly nice having 10 minutes or so to just walk around east campus and wake up a little more before going in. I had a friend who got a bike to get around, and I know he had trouble getting up the hills on campus, so if it’s been a while since you’ve ridden or you’re a little out of shape, I’d consider that.",2021-07-26 15:38:48,3

post,Does any girl feel left out of the gender population?,"Does any girl feel left out of the gender population? I’m a sophomore and honestly in my past year and a half, I never realized how different I was from the mass majority of girls in the school. No it’s not like the “I’m not like other girls” idea, it’s more like “I’m too awkward to socialize with girls who are totally out of my league.” In my opinion, it’s either you’re like a sorority girl with your yoga pants and a big sweater with a Starbuck drink or you’re a widely artistic or liberal students who have strong debates and a sense of fashion. I’m just a student who studies, eat, sleep, and repeat with no known qualities that be described as interesting. I could be wrong about these stereotypes or maybe it’s because I know I’m a loser but I do wish I could have more girlfriends or be included in a group where I get invited to hang out with. My friends were mostly guys who are awesome but man, sometimes you feel like you’re alone seeing that you can’t really talk about “certain topics” with them. If there’s anyone who feels like that in JMU, hit me up with your best advice. Then again, I’m not so sure there are other girls like me who sees themselves as a missing piece of a puzzle.",2020-12-23 04:28:37,57
comment,Does any girl feel left out of the gender population?,"I feel like there are actually more girls like that than you think. A lot of girls, guys even, will become your stereotypical frat or sorority person on the surface, but underneath they still eat, sleep, repeat, have their own idiosyncrasies etc. You just don't see it because it's behind instagram filters or showing everyone (often trying to prove) that their life is absolutely lush and amazing! But, that's not always the case. It's just a mask and people will do them, you should do you. There's definitely other girls or even guys like you who'll accept you for who you are. My advice would be to put yourself out there just a tad more. Maybe try and open more conversations and take initiative. You'd be surprised how many people you can connect with after their guard is down. Yeah many men won't understand girl talk or can't communicate with you in a way you might prefer, but fill that void with a journal in the time being! You'll definitely meet your girl-friends soon. Especially with 2021, the vaccine, everyone will have renewed hope and a great outlook for the new year. All the best to you!",2020-12-23 06:48:11,45
comment,Does any girl feel left out of the gender population?,"Duuuude I get that. I personally account for like a quarter of my major's female population. Needless to say, I don't have a ton of female besties. I'm in WXJM and I live with a bunch of sorority girls, so I've seen both sides of the spectrum, and tbh everyone is secretly awkward and anxious. Seeing behind the archetypical curtain takes off a lot of the pressure.",2020-12-23 07:56:05,19
comment,Does any girl feel left out of the gender population?,"Sure, I'm pretty similar to you. I don't have many girl friends either and I'm socially awkward too... That being said, have you tried talking to the girls you mentioned? I joined a club, met some people, from there I went to some parties... Some of the nicest girls I met were the starbucks/artistic variety, but I had to try and engage. There's also plenty that are in between like you. You'll learn that most people aren't actually that interesting either, they're just trying their best to find their identity as well. Some are full of it, some are genuine. So don't sweat it thinking you are worlds apart, when really you're both at JMU preparing for the future and just trying to have fun. It sounds like you need to loosen up on yourself tbh. I'm sure you're fine- you mentioned that you have friends, so that's proof enough that you aren't as bad as you think. Give yourself and others a chance and you'll be surprised by the results. Don't get bogged down if you get rejected sometimes- we've all been there. It's anxiety inducing, sure, but it'll get easier with time and practice. College is an intense social experiment...

It’s really hard to find your clique in college because it just seems overwhelming and COVID has honestly made it so much worse/harder. I don’t know if you’re in orgs but I just joined a bunch, tried to get involved w a bunch of them by going to their events (even if they’re virtual), and making plans to meet up with people. I think you’re gonna have a lot of trial and error (I definitely went through more than I anticipated and I started to lose hope and was acc looking to transfer) but I think that’s also the life experience. Regardless if we don’t necessarily “fit in” at this school, there’s still that small population of people who don’t fit in either; it’s just basically a treasure hunt to try and find them.",2020-12-23 10:47:21,5
comment,Does any girl feel left out of the gender population?,"I understand. I’m about to be a senior and I still don’t know how to interact with other girls on campus. Every time I talk I feel like they look at me like I’m an alien. I’m not even that weird (I don’t think) I’m just not a sorority girl. Or alternatively, I’m immediately the “smart one” since I don’t explain things with a valley girl accent. But let me tell you dude. It doesn’t matter. I know it feels like it does and it makes class activities/group projects weird but I was lucky to find my best friend freshman year and she’s all I need. You’ll find your place and then you’ll find your people and you’ll be happy you didn’t try and fit yourself in somewhere else. I don’t have much advice for you because this isn’t exactly the easiest thing to overcome. I would recommend though to join a organization. I know that’s typically everyone’s advice, but look on the website for JMU organizations and see if there are any you’re passionate about. Even group exercise classes at UREC! I wouldn’t have met my best friend if it wasn’t for our organization. Organizations bring like-minded people together. Personally, I don’t have any interest but I know plenty of people who rave about Student Ambassadors and Saferides. They structure themselves like psuedo-fraternities where you get a “big” and a family and are very welcoming. I think honor societies are the same. An honor society or a major-based professional greek org is actually another really great idea because not only will there be potential friends but potential networking opportunities and career-based experiences to add to your resume and get your name in places. This is the one thing I wish I had done. That’s really all I have for you. And if all else fails, I’ll be your friend and we can be unfitted-puzzle-piece alien girls together.",2020-12-23 08:59:02,5

I started doing research in the STEM department this year and my group mates are super welcoming and overall great. There will also be people who are more preppy/artistic who will still be awesome friends and accept you as you are but just express themselves differently.

Also in less your over 60 or have pre existing health condition then you don’t have much to worry about. Imo containment went out the window long ago.

comment,I can’t believe they closed in March but are opening now,"I think that, no matter what, being in person is a bad option. It breaks my heart but it’s true. I know students will come and party regardless of classes being online, but that’s not a reason to hold classes in person. The situation would be astronomically better with no students in dorms and no dining halls, in person classes, or library mingling. I think that JMU should be all online. I understand that hurts a lot of students who study the arts or have lab classes, but their priority should be the health of themselves and the people around them. Hell, take a semester off! We need to get rid of the stigma around taking more than 4 years to graduate. It’s a global pandemic. It’s happening to everybody, not just JMU. It may not satisfy you to be online, but it also won’t kill you. I think JMU should reduce tuition. I understand that they need to pay their employees and that they are a business, so I’m not suggesting huge slashes. I’m suggesting we get refunded the money of perks we no longer get to experience online (like UREC, athletics, etc). I know JMU is a business and they are trying to make a profit, but they are choosing money of the lives of their staff and students. They sent us home for our safety in March, but now at the peak of the pandemic they want us back? It’s about the money. If Harvard with all of their resources admitted they cannot hold in person classes safely, JMU simply cannot either. I think JMU is doing everything they can to safely enforce their back to campus plan, but I think their back to campus plan is flawed. I want nothing more than for life to go back to normal, see my friends, enjoy the advertised JMU experience, but unfortunately that just isn’t a safe option anymore.

comment,I can’t believe they closed in March but are opening now,"I believe that as it stands, not only JMU, but much of the American higher education system simply cannot afford to move to a completely virtual semester. So much of the revenue of a college has come to rely on residents who live on campus. Colleges these days constantly race to spend and improve because without that they fall behind compared to the rest of the pack. It's sad to see that higher ed institutions have changed their priorities, but it also represents the priorities of American families and students who choose to attend schools based on athletic merit, shiny new facilities, fancy residential halls, recreational centers, and other things not directly related to education. But people simply can't fathom losing their ***college expereince*** /s I bet it's incredibly stressful to be a college admin. They have to balance politics, finances, safety, health, and so many more facets of running a college. Issues that relate to the American education system and money have their roots in decades of politics, and it can't simply be boiled down to ""admin only cares about money."" The entire college system is inherently 'greedy' so they can fuel their constant expansion, whether or not that's an issue is up to what you value in a college. Focusing on funding educational resources seems like the clear option to students; however, the current higher ed market paints a different picture.",2020-08-01 21:08:04,10
comment,I can’t believe they closed in March but are opening now,"Comparing JMU, a large public state institution to Harvard, a private ivy institution isn't exactly a fair comparison. I was not at all surprised to see that private institutions announced their move to virtual quickly. And I was also not surprised to see public institutions, including JMU, take a comparatively long time to put out any official communication. Harvard has an endowment of 40.9 ***billion*** while JMU has an endowment of only 111.1 ***million*** Further, as a state school, JMU has to deal with the constant cuts that are made to state education spending while trying their best not to raise the price of tuition and remaining accessible. Harvard on the other hand, charges their students 50k+ per year, and while they may give out generous amounts of financial aid, a lot of that money comes from their massive endowment. State schools like JMU cannot *afford* to not have students on campus. They rely on housing costs, dining, parking, and other revenue streams to stay in the green, while institutions like Harvard can 100% afford to go virtual because they can just sit on their bankroll and their endowment without a care in the world. Like it or not, that's the reality of our current higher ed system. Public institutions play a dangerous financial game balancing revenue with funding, while private schools do everything they can to grow their endowment.",2020-08-01 21:21:36,3
comment,I can’t believe they closed in March but are opening now,"As an alum with several professor friends, you're partially right. There are other things at work, too: the university is making very plain that another semester at a loss will result in numerous positions being cut. They have also pretty much railroaded any faculty input -- JMU's faculty senate/organization has been fairly weak overall, from what I gather. Also, a few of the professors also have syllabi that will be covering the eventual closure.

comment,I can’t believe they closed in March but are opening now,"As an alumnus who was allowed to enjoy JMU's incredibly affordable tuition rates, I totally believe it when you say that JMU is not flush with cash and would be certainly be hurting if even one semester was online. I think one of the biggest issues is that JMU is not transparent as to why they are pushing so hard to maintain in-person activities. They will keep saying they ""want to provide the educational experience that students deserve"". (I understand that they are, of course, not the only university guilty of this). But realistically how good is this experience going to be when professors and students are all uncomfortable? Professors aren't even given notice when a student has contracted COVID because of HIPAA, making things worse. When the administration sends an email telling students they expect them to quarantine 8 days before entering Harrisonburg, and they are depending on students to ""make good judgments"" as one of the key points of their re-opening plan, it's kind of insulting to the community. Just like the rest of the economy has had to do, universities must make sacrifices for the sake of the safety of its staff and students. Perhaps this might call for tenured professors to take a large pay cut as you said, or layoffs of less-essential staff. Maybe JMU will have to raise tuition rates in future semesters when things get better.

What happened to me means I’m living in the past or clearly making it up because you don’t see it? I saw a girl walking maybe 10 feet in front of me two weeks ago headed to her car and a truck pulled over and the guy inside started making inappropriate comments towards her. “They’re just some redneck” as you put it. It’s fucked up. This shouldn’t be happening period and I feel bad for your girlfriend if you have one because I know she sure as hell wouldn’t want this to happen to her because not only is it terrifying, it’s disgusting. The Oxford definition of cat call is “make a whistle, shout, a comment of a sexual nature to a woman passing by”. So my term sure as hell isn’t outdated. I dunno how you couldn’t see it. I never go downtown by myself anymore especially if I have to walk because every time I’ve been cat called it’s happened near downtown, not without saying it’s happened in other places too.",2021-09-18 00:31:25,11

I don’t dress this way anyway but getting attention like this from guys regardless of what you wear is gross. I don’t like that kind of attention. I don’t wear tight clothes or too short of clothes.

That’s genuinely terrible though. It’s def okay to be scared, I’m still wary just on a regular day in broad daylight even tho it’s been a bit since I’ve had to deal with super sketchy dudes. Definitely keep the pepper spray! I also recommend these little safety alarms. You can get them off of Amazon. They’re really loud. I don’t care for pepper spray personally because of a self defense class I took in high school so the alarms were a safe bet for me. They’ll draw attention and likely scare anyone off if someone tried anything. It happens from time to time even if you Don’t normally go out after dark.

Here at UNC some would give us credit for a fair bit of transparency, and yet I still had to get a LOT of information from social media, Black/POC and Graduate student worker & employee union groups, and journalists who were collating information from nearly every source possible. If JMU won't say yes or no, if possible I'd even see if someone can call local hotels and see if they're offering rooms available during the 1st and 2nd weeks of school after move-in - if they're full/nearly at capacity, that means the school likely has blocks they've booked in case. If someone knows a worker in Dining Services, have them probe or look to see if they're creating any plans to provide meals off-campus -- if you're quarantined in a hotel they would need to bring you food.",2020-08-20 12:08:41,3

comment,Influx of JMU alumni who are successful entrepreneurs & CEO's,"I know why. These socialist-leaning arguments aren't anything new. Unfortunately, it's the reality of the world we live in. So either we change the system, exit the system altogether, or dominate it. The CEO's listed above chose the third option. Are they better people than the average employee of their respective companies? Not necessarily. But at least JMU will benefit by receiving gifts for its endowment, its students an easier access to getting into those companies, etc.",2019-12-04 21:26:24,-1
comment,Influx of JMU alumni who are successful entrepreneurs & CEO's,"I mean, I get where you're coming from. But this is very much a trickle down approach to economics which has been proven time and time again not to work. Not just in America, but across any country with a large wealth gap between the rich and the middle/lower classes. JMU artificially inflates their budget 2-3 percent per year to the tune of a $3-5 million deficit, and makes up that deficit by raising tuition and fees— therefore putting the financial burden and constraints on students and parents. JMU also receives capital improvement funding through the state legislature to finance their construction projects. So again, the financial burden for propping up JMU comes from the taxpayers. What you're talking about is a wealthy alum coming in at the last minute and paying a few million dollars to tack their name onto a building. And that money goes into JMU's Foundation which is exempt from certain taxes and continues to grow with the economy (currently sitting at over $100 million), yet the university hardly spends it. They never tap into it to relieve the students and parents of annual tuition/fee increases, even though 10 percent of it is unrestricted and can be spent however. In no way does a wealthy alum benefit the *students* or the *faculty*. Unless you consider being hired by one of these companies post-graduation a perk, which is hardly a sure thing.",2019-12-05 13:20:11,1
comment,Influx of JMU alumni who are successful entrepreneurs & CEO's,"When we open up alumni giving over a longer time horizon, and the endowment gets big enough to be in the $1 billion+ range, it will start making a difference. $60+ million gifts like these are really game changers: https://news.virginia.edu/content/frank-m-sands-srs-68-million-gift-largest-darden-history, and that isn't even considered one of the white whales when it comes to endowment giving. Besides, what is really the value of a university? It's brand recognition. All University is is a signalling mechanism to employers (& society) that the student can get into that university. Students care about the alumni that have graduated from a particular university. It might not be the biggest factor, but it matters. This is why Harvard/Yale/Princeton/Stanford have cornered the market in Alumni giving. Prestige is brand. And brand gets support from its alumni, and attracts better students (who will in turn have a higher probability of having a handful of students that can become those outliers like CEOs, world class athletes, superstar entertainers, etc). It's the brand.",2019-12-05 14:59:16,1

And the JMU COVID dashboard shows that over 70% of students and faculty (at least because many haven’t reported anything at all) are already vaccinated. So, if these restrictions are already being put in place when the vast majority of the community is already vaccinated, it’s not out of the question that the JMU administration will pursue more severe policies. For the record, I want us to go back with no restrictions in place at all, but, considering JMU’s history of handling COVID, I’d expect more restrictions as opposed to the mask mandate being revoked.",2021-08-09 19:32:46,8

If we bar the students who aren't vaccinated there's a good chance it'll be seen as discrination against those with disabilities. I agree with you though.

So many parties were thrown off campus anyways that test results immediatey become meaningless as those students come back on campus and interact with others. Plus it would have just clogged up the testing queues and delayed results of people who actually had symptoms,2020-09-01 11:26:03,13

comment,This is crazy and I want to ✨cry✨,"I agree with you, but I wish we could have been better prepared for testing on campus at the UHC and even in the community.

I think the vast majority of people at school do want to return, but those who don't are the most vocal on here.

Honestly as amped up as I am to go and excited to start college on campus the anxiety of leaving home and just not knowing when or how we will be sent home is not fun. I can’t wait to get there but at the same time I feel naive for thinking it’ll be okay while we are there.

However, JMU’s lack of, I should say preparation has sickened me. I’m usually an optimist however I almost guarantee that the reason that we’re going back isn’t that JMU feels like it’s safe, rather they’re just brute forcing us to the add/drop date to ensure that they have our money. I love JMU, I’ve wanted to go since I was a sophomore in high school, I’ve met friends and created memories I wouldn’t want anywhere else. However I don’t see us doing any of that this semester...

comment,"Okay, I have to know.","Honestly no, I do not want to go back to campus, nor do I look forward to it. I find masks uncomfortable and humid, the bussing situation sounds awful already, and I don’t trust my fellow classmates not to party. I would rather go fully online. I can understand why some people may feel like they need to be in class to learn, which is why it’s wild to me that JMU hasn’t offered an online option for some students who may just feel more comfortable at home. Edit: read some more comments and the thought came to mind that a lot of people in this thread may still be living with parents or family. That sucks, I hated the summer after my freshman year when I had to go back home, and still being in that position would totally change my opinion. Thankfully I’ve been independent since 19 and living in Harrisonburg since then, so that definitely influences my feelings towards “staying home.”",2020-08-11 18:18:53,2

comment,"Okay, I have to know.","Definitely want to go back. While of course covid is a serious public health issue, I worry with students being stuck at home. Some come from troubled households, others are battling with mental health issues in isolation. Unfortunately, there is no easy solution to all of this. People will suffer regardless of whether we're online or in person. I'd rather be in person because that's just how I learn best. Last semester my grades tanked being online, and taking a semester off isn't really an option for me.

comment,"Okay, I have to know.","It all boils down to whether everyone can wear a mask at all times. Which I know damn well JMU is going to strictly enforce. Maybe JMU should've had it where Freshman and Seniors were the only ones able to come back or even looking at which majors would be most affected (STEM, the arts, idk what else) and allow students of those majors to come back. Although I'm sure there are tons of students that just can't learn online from a variety of majors as stated with some of the comments in this thread. 3 out of 4 of my classes are online this semester and the experience wasn't horrible, but in-class learning is so much better.

comment,"Okay, I have to know.","I think it's important to reconcile what people *want* versus what's in the best interest of public health. There just isn't a way to bring in 20,000 college kids from all over the country in a safe way. We only need to look to the small number of schools that have already opened back up, the recent attempts by the MLB to resume the season, or any other large gathering of people since the spring. There's *always* an outbreak. There's no way to avoid it–especially with college kids with a taste for partying and not following the rules. I don't think anyone is saying that online classes are optimal. Nothing is optimal right now. But it is the world we're living in. I would hope at the very least that JMU give people the option to stay at home and complete their courses online. But they can't even do that. They're forcing people to make very tough decisions and choose between their education and their health.",2020-08-10 09:28:52,8

I think if they didn't have to, JMU wouldn't do anything outside of requiring masks and doing extra cleaning (just not to the point where the entire fall schedule had to be adjusted). I will say I'm not looking forward to wearing a mask all day, that's for sure.

Over 100,000 recent alumni from schools across the nation were asked if they could do it all over again, would they choose the same school, and JMU scored number 5. Let that sink in.

comment,JMU PACKED THE APP,Beat Appalachian state in football. App state was very close to being a top 25 team so JMU will most likely be ranked top 25 with the win. Also Middle Tennessee just thoroughly beat a ranked Miami. And JMU routed Middle Tennessee like 44-7.,2022-09-24 20:37:04,18
comment,JMU PACKED THE APP,"JMU probably still won’t be ranked, but definitely should hit the “receiving votes” list. Stay undefeated for one or two more weeks and I think we get in the Top 25.",2022-09-25 01:00:54,13

comment,Shows how much JMU cares,"JMU lost a lot of money last year, so of course they're not going to care now. gotta build those stadiums and buy all new uniforms and equipment!! let's not forget president alger, who made nearly $530,000 in 2019, and then 11% less the following year. We can't have that now can we? it's not only students we have to worry about catching COVID and possibly dying - there are teachers, coaches, food staff, cleaning staff.. so many people across every demographic, many of whom are likely to have autoimmune disorders or disabilities that put them at an even higher risk of death. It's time they start focusing on the bottom tiers, instead of solely the top 1%. Most JMU housekeeping staff haven't seen a raise in many, many years.. but they're the ones cleaning up after all the parties taking place in classrooms, and all the piss literally soaking your bathroom floors. Food staff are even more unappreciated overall. I know you didn't ask for this rant but it's beyond frustrating.

comment,Shows how much JMU cares,"The university has made it quite difficult to move a class online, even temporarily (case in point - I'm sure the technology is well in place to have had Tuesday's first-day classes conducted online, at least for a great many courses, but that wasn't one of the listed methods of ""making up"" that class). I needed to miss time due to being a close contact last semester. I was fine, not sick, just shouldn't be in a position to infect others. I needed to get special permission from my dept head and dean just to do that. They were fine with it, because they are good and reasonable people. But it was embarrassing to have to ask, and I wouldn't do it unless I absolutely had to - and I suspect that is the way the senior leadership of the university wants it.In some ways I understand their position. But truthfully, it has delivered a serious hit to faculty morale - it is apparent senior leadership doesn't trust the faculty. There are several flashpoints between faculty and senior leadership right now (including a recent faculty senate resolution taking the hiring of new faculty out of faculty hands, and moved to the Provost's office).",2022-01-19 14:10:49,8

post,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,"Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars. JMU decided that they would tow all student commuter cars on the lowest levels of the east campus parking deck to the 4th level 3 hours before the basketball game. After I finish my TA shift for which JMU pays me very little I come back to my parking spot and my car is gone. I then track down a parking services worker since I assumed my car was towed who informed me they moved the cars and I spend the next 20 minutes looking for my car. There were no signs or any indication that this was going to happen when I parked this morning besides a slip I was given a week ago (which I forgot about) with no dates and no times. JMU just resold the parking spot that students pay $300 for so people can reserve special spots for a game that students tuition pays for. Fortunately for me my car does not seem to be damaged from the towing, but did everyone get this lucky? Also to be clear I wouldn’t have had as much of a problem if this was clearly laid out with SIGNS on the day of games. JMU has shown over and over to me that they could not care less about their students if they make even a single extra dollar. Does anyone have any more information about what levels they will tow or if they will start giving tickets?",2021-11-09 21:26:37,51
comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,it really annoyed me because they dont tell you which levels you cant park in besides saying “the lower levels”,2021-11-09 22:14:01,24
comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,There were a bunch of signs at the entrances and throughout the lower levels about the No parking notice. Plus they came by two weeks ago 3 days in a row and put pink fliers on every car in the parking deck about the upcoming regulations. Idk what to tell you,2021-11-09 23:26:32,27
comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,"Parking services is not your friend in the slightest. I learned recently that according to them, all of their funding comes from towing, tickets, and parking pass fees.

comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,"When in doubt, just park on the top floor. It's inconvenient but you won't have to worry about whether your car is in a reserved area.",2021-11-10 09:34:42,3

comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,Small point but your tuition doesn’t go towards athletics. It legally can’t. Only an athletics fee does.,2021-11-09 22:59:26,3
comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,There were none when I parked that morning. It’s possible they put them up later. One sign at the entrance is not good enough either I don’t believe. They should clearly mark the spots they want and not be ambiguous.,2021-11-10 08:54:25,8
comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,But if everyone fills those two floors up then where do pep band members park? Just trying to genuinely ask because I genuinely don’t have any choice but to drive there and park. I’m not about to try to park in another deck and walk my instrument there because it’s fairly heavy and the cold weather isn’t good for it.,2021-11-10 18:09:24,2
comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,"When I was a student it was about $4k a year per student for athletics. I also know when I was a student there was no way to opt out of paying that fee. Because of this I would consider OPs point about ""student tuition"" paying for the games as a valid point. If that fee did not have to be paid to attend JMU as a student I would agree with you. In this case I see where OP is coming from.",2021-11-10 09:00:32,11
comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,It also legally can't go towards parking. That is why there is a separate fee for a permit.,2021-11-10 07:50:12,1
comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,"I’m not positive, but you might be able to park in festi lots or maybe the resident lot on the other side of university boulevard.

comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,Stuff like this sounds like why few people on the state recruiting circuit take JMU seriously.

comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,"You’re talking to a guy that played hockey in undergrad where the only thing the university gave us was permission to use the school colors. It was pay to play, dues required like a fraternity, and the nearest rentable ice was an hour away. Meanwhile the school has 100+ football players and 20+ ribbon twirlers on scholarship. I detest college sports and think the law should be that the athletics department in any public school has to 100% fund itself, with extensive annual audits, stadiums and scholarships all. That or the athletics fee should have an available waiver for anyone not looking to give a shit about any of the teams. If your team can’t sustain itself, it shouldn’t exist.",2021-11-10 10:39:45,4
comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,Again at JMU each student pays more per year than some Duke Club members. Sure it brings in donations but for JMU those donations are smaller than the amount paid into the athletics program by students.,2021-11-10 13:05:06,2

comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,"🤷‍♂️ collegiate recruiting for software is a dirty game, I don’t make the rules. JMU not having its own annual 72 hour hackathon is another reason why we don’t pay much attention to their programs.",2021-11-10 16:04:45,1
comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,"Being able to throw together shitty, unmaintainable code to make a shitty product in a short amount of time with little to no sleep is not a very good representation of students’ competence in the workplace either.

comment,Basketball game apparently requires towing students cars.,"You’ve missed the point of hackathons completely. It’s about being able to observe students as they work through problems, teach themselves new things, and function on a team, all while having constant access to recruiters.

In addition, by denying us the remainder of Spring semester Alger is preventing Sundress Season, arguably the best time of the year. Judges will likely award punitive damages as well for Alger’s egregious behavior and mistreatment of students.

comment,STUDENTS: Civil Lawsuit Against Alger,"You abhorrent scum. You ignorant fool. I will sue you Alger. You are going to be the target of the greatest lawsuit the world has ever seen. You don't know why? It's completely obvious. It's so obvious, the most deplorable peasant could grasp the full magnitude of your wickedness and treachery with the greatest of ease. Your actions cry out for mercy, and I will be happy to deliver it. And if you're thinking this is a mistake, or merely a deception of mine, you're sadly mistaken, my friend. I have indisputable proof of your continued harassment and other offenses. Even without it, the jury would take one look at you and decide. The incomprehensible magnitude of your crimes brings with it unavoidable, infinite guilt, and whether you notice it or not, everyone else does. Are you interested in who will be serving as the offense attorney? I'll tell you. It's my father. Your defense? It doesn't matter, in fact, they might just not give you one even to spare just one individual from the trauma. My father is the greatest lawyer in the US, the world, and human history, including the future, which he knows due to the fact that he sued the future and they travelled back in time to tell him. He's served for hundreds of Supreme Court cases, and he's won every single one. You may have never thought about being court-marshaled, but now, that's a real threat. That is the power of my father, a culmination of flawless, supreme logic and a perfect knowledge of the law. You will lose this case, your money, and your life. Does that scare you, insignificant bug? Because it should. The entire history of the U.S. Judicial System has been leading up to this moment, where all of its fury is concentrated on ruining your life. My father won't even need to help. Your heinous crimes will be evident to all, so just give up, you crook. Give up before you're forced to.",2020-04-03 09:53:31,28

You're a first generation college student, that's an amazing circumstance and you should be proud of that! For me, I just want a stable income to support myself without stressing about bills. You can get there too, even though it is hard (economic struggles are a whole different part of this). And when it comes to what other people think, dude...no one thinks about you as much as you. When do you ever hear someone say ""nice to meet you, what's your income and value of your house?"" No one cares, and I don't mean that maliciously, I just mean no one even thinks about these things.

comment,How do I stop feeling shitty about being poor?,"You are effectively comparing yourself to other peoples' parents, who have had 30 or more years to build their wealth or credit. As a first generation college student, you should instead look at higher education as your opportunity to do the same. There are a lot of people (and parents) who fund their lifestyles by debt. Debt is not inherently bad, but it's about the amount of leverage. It would not surprise me in the least if 75% of these families were 2 paychecks away from bankruptcy. You feel inadequate now, but there's a huge ""keeping up with the Jones'"" factor, especially in the DMV (I'm in Nebraska now). You're a college student! There is a stereotype that you're supposed to be poor! It's also worth mentioning that a lot of these rich kids burn out. They party too hard and flunk out because they've never known boundaries. They get hooked on alcohol / worse. If they make it through, they're often the most dim light in a meeting. They did nothing to actually educate themselves. Of course, nepotism guarantees them a job post grad, but rest assured they suck at it. Overall just be yourself. I honestly do not understand why you're so embarrassed. Unless your place is dirty and nasty (which you can solve by spending a few hours cleaning - a lot of college students do not clean as often as they should) then you have no reason to be embarrassed. It's always nice to go into a wonderfully decorated place, but realize they're paying through the ass for that. I lived above the train tracks; no shame here! Anyone who disparages another over income levels is not worth your time. However, don't mistake befuddlement for scorn; after all, what could a banana cost? $10? Being broke / living in a shitty house is part of being a college student. Some might be surprised at your situation, but that doesn't mean they're a bad person. You should consider it an opportunity to educate the person regarding the realities facing regular people. You all have to remember that you are all learning how to be an adult and that whatever experience you have had may not even be remotely similar to someone else's. Don't immediately write people off, but listen and talk. That skill will get you way beyond the ""rich kids"". But don't be envious. Just do what you want to do.

But I have never felt so alone in my life, I probably have a max of like five friends a couple of whom I met through a club which is fine. But I feel like if you’re not a certain type of person you don’t belong at this school and it’s hard to fit in and find people. I kinda feel destined to be alone my college life, which is sad to say but I feel weirdly calm about and don’t mind it, but at the same time I kinda did wish I could get over my anxiety and get out more. I know I can’t switch schools due to certain reasons but I’m kinda fine with that, I guess my college experience won’t be like others but I’m weirdly okay with that and being alone.",2019-03-24 20:00:57,54
comment,My Experience at JMU,"Hey there, sophomore here going through the same feeling of loneliness. I cope with it through various ways because I need to get out of the apartment because it reminds me about how lonely I am. 1) GO TO UREC: can’t stress this enough, I always go alone and it usually is the highlight of my day because I feel so much better about myself through it. 2) Get a Job, join a different club: meeting people is hard for me. I just got accepted to a job and I am excited to be a part of something that lets me meet new people! I was part of the marching band here and I HATED IT. There is just a feeling in a lot of the clubs here where the members isolate the newer members. If you really like a club, join one with one of your hall mates/roomates who are also finding difficulty in the JMU life, bond with them. 3) Invite friends over from high school!: Bit of a nostalgia trip and a sigh of relief at the same time. Keep in touch with your friends back home and ask them if they would like to come down and visit where you could show the around the campus. Or even do it during Madi-palooza!?!? 4) don’t stress out about feeling alone: some nights I would cry in my bed because I wasn’t making friends here. I hated being here because everyone has different priorities than compared to high school. You just need to realize that loneliness is NEVER a bad thing, but the idea that thinking it is bad to be lonely is not healthy for you. 5) stay outside of your room unless you are sleeping; you aren’t going to meet a new friend here by sitting in your room going on your phone all day long. Go anywhere! The Library, office hours, D-hall. ANYWHERE 6) talk to classmates about forming a group study (I only did this once, but it helped): it is never too late to do this, just ask around don’t be shy, chances are they are just as nervous if they wanted to ask. 7) Go home whenever you can/want on the weekends or call your parents whenever you can: I’ve grown closer with my parents because of this and they can help you through this because they understand you more than anyone. 8) REMEMBER THIS PLEASE (these words helped me through a lot during my time here at JMU) : “this is the day to improve myself” - I try to say these words to myself every morning. I want today to be the day to remember, the day I meet my future best friend, the day I meet my future SO. You can’t think “maybe tomorrow will be better” but you can’t wait for your happiness to change you have to do it NOW. I really wish there were more students here at JMU who didn’t feel like their dream school is an empty wasteland, like some of us do. I hope you find happiness during your time here friends. You are never alone. If you ever feel like this situation is hurting your mental health, Please go the the counseling center. JMU never told me about it until I had to ask around.

comment,My Experience at JMU,"Seeing all the comments here is really profound. I can assure you that what your feeling is not your ""fault."" JMU has a real big cultural divide between Greek life and everyone else. Most people are in the ""everyone else"" and feel isolated when in fact they are the majority of students in the school. &#x200B; Things I see: 1- JMU students often think going to events alone as taboo. This makes organizing events a nightmare since either no people show up or 1000 people decide they'll be there. As someone who runs multiple clubs and organizes many many events on campus this is one thing I'd like to see changed about the community. 2 - JMU is not an openly social environment, this issue is directly related to the terrible Greek life community at the school. Think of the quad in between classes. Is anyone talking? How many people do you know and just walk by without saying hi? In class, how many people ask questions? 3 - The lack of community spaces. If you're one of the lucky majors on campus you will have a lounge entirely dedicated to being a work and social space of your 'major.' There are too few of these spots and often people go through their entire four years without really feeling like they're part of their specific academic community. &#x200B; Solutions and Proposals: A - A club specifically intended to organize casual meet and greets. B - An hour on campus where people are encouraged to drop there phones and talk to others around them. C - A meetup spot agreed upon as a place to meet other redditors! Imagine sitting at the music circle thing and someone comes up to you and says hey are you also one of the reddit users? Kind of proud of this idea, but it definitely needs some more thought... D - A dedicated group that goes to things like Funny Freakin Fridays together as I way to get out and meet new people. &#x200B; This post has gotten too long... please leave feedback. What would you like too see here on campus? If there's interest in any of my ideas or any others I'll make an effort to organize it and make it a reality! <3 &#x200B;",2019-03-24 21:32:45,13

Do as well as you can on your assignments and prep for your tests/exams. Yes, you'll be the one staying home while everyone goes out to get plastered, but, hey, that's what you were going to do anyway. Then, when you get older and think about your time at JMU, you will be able to honestly say you ""got something"" out of it. Of course, my experience is over a decade old, so take it for what it's worth. EDIT: Though, I have to say, OP, that I see the same thing you're seeing. You say you're not enjoying life at JMU, and almost everyone responds with ""well, just get happy!""",2019-03-25 07:16:20,5
comment,My Experience at JMU,"Yeah, JMU culture is very homogenous, so you'll hardly ever find people going against the whole 'this place is Disney world', which only exacerbates your problems. Overall, inclusivity isn't this campus' greatest strength and people are too much of the same. If you're not a jock bro, it's going to be more difficult to make this place feel like home, but thats also not hard and fast. I felt the same way before I transferred out, but with that being said join sports clubs or an im team. Those are the best ways to make friends and find a real social circle. Put yourself out there, be confident and funny, and ask people to hang out on the weekends if you've made good ground. Don't waste too much time trying to socially invest in other professional and major related clubs unless you join an eboard. JMU culture makes it feel really easy that if you're not in a frat, you don't belong (at least amongst cob majors). Anecdotally could honest to god never meet another normal guy that wasn't in a frat even though the rate is only ~20%. East campus majors might be a little more chill and down to earth though.

comment,My Experience at JMU,"It’s not how many people you meet, it’s how much you - yes you - decide to invest into the ones you choose. Investing means going out of your way for someone, doing something unexpected and selfless and acting when not asked. Years after I graduated those folks who I invested and who invested back (which wasn’t everyone) didn’t transpire after graduation. Look inward to get the meaningful relationships you desire. Also ditch any preconception of what college experience is suppose to be. You write it for you - get to the right mindset and you won’t be alone. That’s my advice anyway.",2019-03-24 22:34:05,5
comment,My Experience at JMU,"It can be really tough to be in a setting like JMU that's filled with extroverts when maybe you're more of an introvert. I spent a lot of my time at JMU playing video games and staying in. It wasn't until my last year when I decided to live downtown with randoms that things really opened up. I was able to become good friends with people in that house and really start enjoying myself. If I were you I would try mixing things up.

comment,My Experience at JMU,"This definitely happens more than you think. I’ve been here 6 years because of loneliness. My freshman year my entire hall made me feel unwelcome so I figured everybody felt the same way towards me. I didn’t drink until I was 21 and people took that as I didn’t party which wasn’t true. My freshman year roommate only said 5 words max to me at a time. So I just went to class and came back. My sophomore roommate hated me and was never in the room and I was just part of 1 club but because of what it was I didn’t really reach out to the other members to do things. My 3rd year I lived in a house with like 5 other guys none of which I knew. So that didn’t help. The pst 3 years I’ve been lucky and my major has a student lounge we can use so I try and spend more time in there to talk to people but I’m also older than most people in my major so I don’t really do to much with them outside of it. I was stubborn and because I was made to feel unwanted by my freshman dorm, I figured that extended to the entire school. I’m sure there’s people all over who are willing to do stuff with you if you reach out. The one piece of advice I always give to students who are incoming freshman is join clubs and try and join a club that you’re not completely interested in but have a slight interest in. You’ll meet people who also are into it and can show you things about it.",2019-03-30 10:28:40,2

comment,My Experience at JMU,"> JMU has a real big cultural divide between Greek life and everyone else. Most people are in the ""everyone else"" and feel isolated when in fact they are the majority of students in the school. >JMU is not an openly social environment, this issue is directly related to the terrible Greek life community at the school. Think of the quad in between classes. Is anyone talking? How many people do you know and just walk by without saying hi? In class, how many people ask questions? Genuinely sums it perfectly. JMU's 'diversity' efforts aren't going to solve these anti-social and non-inclusive problems, which in large part are just a symptom of being a huge party school (or really the greek life) and a little bit the gender inequity. Their community standards are pretty lackluster compared to other schools for how good of a game they like to talk. People can be immensely cold to you for no reason (even young people working jobs post-college in their cities aren't this cold and anti-social), thus making people shy away from putting themselves out there towards others hence why no one shows up to events by themselves.",2019-03-24 22:24:01,11

It is a casual meet and greet with free tea. The event has the same regulars every week but most of them are very friendly to new people. It is not unusual for high ranking JMU administrators show up and mingle with students. **Response to C** \- Do any redditors want to do Tea Time this week?,2019-03-26 01:46:02,2
comment,My Experience at JMU,I see your major is CS. If you have not met any of the upperclassmen in your major I would recommend you to reach out to the CS department clubs or stop by the lounges or labs and say hi. There are some friendly people in the department who are open to new people. If none of the Sports or Hobby clubs appeal to you I would advise you to look for volunteer opportunities. A good way to find them is to reach out to Coders Anonymous for CS related opportunities. You will also be receiving a email to your dukes email about a opportunity volunteering at CHOICES. While you are doing community service talk to the people you are with. If you enjoy volunteering then I would advise you to look into joining a service organization next year (Speak to Student Activities and Involvement for a list of service organizations).,2019-03-26 01:32:28,3

I tried to join groups and organizations during my time there, and I found that, even in the ""official"" clubs that 75% of the conversation was exchanging stories about being drunk, and another 15% about how they couldn't wait to be drunk again.

Looking back now it definitely helped me become the person I am today! And loneliness and all I would do it again. Also would definitely recommend getting involved in UREC - that place was my second home, and it's huge now! there is so much there for you to try! Get those happy hormones flowing!

comment,My Experience at JMU,Club sports are going to have the highest social factor just because the focus won't be on school or your studies. People will actually want to get to know each other and do things. Get in a groupme and make connections. Or find a club that is hobby related. Thats why I don't hugely recommend study groups or academic clubs. People in those don't make the effort to become friends because the reason they're there in the first place just isn't conducive to that.,2019-03-24 22:31:12,7
comment,My Experience at JMU,"Club Sports and Hobby Clubs are both good options to meet new people. If you are a gamer I would advise you to look into joining PlayMU. If you can not find a Club or Sport that interests you then look at the Service-Oriented organisations (Ex: Campus Assault ResponsE, Relay for Life, Safe Rides, Student Ambassadors, Student Government Association, University Program Board, etc...). That will give you the opportunity to meet people like yourself that are looking for a place to fit in and decided to become a cog in the unseen structure of the community. Some of those organisations also have toxicity but in almost all cases it is isolated to those affiliated with Greek Life. Most other people in those organisations are going to be currently in your shoes or where in your shoes at some point. Those are the people you will most likely connect with.",2019-03-26 01:18:23,2

post,Eagle Hall heat?,"Eagle Hall heat? Eagle Hall is like some fucked up version of a FNAF spinoff where you can only have any sort of privacy if you close your room door but if you do you have zero AC and the temperature goes to to like 85 in ten minutes so you have to open the door again and listen to your hall mate hooligans until it’s cold enough again to shut the door without being boiled alive by the Harrisonburg August heat. At least it’s good for getting to know people, I guess everyone in Eagle hall has a “we’re all in this together” mentality If this fucking building caught on fire I’d think the AC just broke I swear",2024-08-26 07:55:12,52

One of the big problems with it likely had to do with the state of technology of the time, in that this food stand was not set up to accept dining dollars or Flex. I loved the chuckwagon, but I rarely had cash, so I couldn't patronize them as often as I might have if they had accepted JAC card payments - especially when you consider that the lake area at that time was something of a food desert. Other than Mrs. Green's, which only operated for lunch service, the nearest dining facilities were PC Dukes and D-Hall, and Mister Chips was also a decent walk away. I imagine that, considering the state of wireless data communication at the time (i.e. more or less nonexistent), they couldn't accept JAC cards because there was no jack for a network connection on the outside of Showker - or most other buildings, for that matter.",2022-05-28 04:32:07,1

post,Online Through Spring,"Online Through Spring Full email from Alger: Dear JMU students, As we all know, in recent days we have witnessed a dizzying array of developments related to the spread of COVID-19, along with a significant amount of new guidance that has been issued from state and federal agencies. Taking these and many other factors into consideration, I write today with important updates regarding keeping classes online through the end of the semester, closing the residence halls (with very limited exceptions) and issuing refunds, and postponing Spring Commencement ceremonies. These are incredibly difficult choices to make, but we are guided by principles of community well-being and ethical decision-making that are hallmarks of JMU. The JMU experience is, first and foremost, about our people and how we interact, so the concept of social distancing feels contrary to our very nature. And yet we live in a moment when extraordinary measures are required to protect people around us. My heart aches for all of you who have poured yourselves completely into your own unique and special Madison experiences. It was impossible for any of you—or indeed any of us—to have imagined that the school year, and for some your academic time at Madison, would end in this way. I am deeply sorry for these incredible disruptions in your lives, yet I also know that Dukes are caring, resilient, and capable of working together to meet any challenge. With that can-do spirit in mind, let me share steps we are taking to promote public health and safety, while also ensuring that each of you can successfully continue and complete your academic journey. **Online and remote instruction has been extended through the remainder of spring semester.** The university most recently communicated that classes would be held online or remotely through at least April 5. In light of updated guidance from federal and state governments, we have decided to continue with online and remote learning through the end of spring semester, which will include final exams. I recognize that this is disappointing news for many students who had hopes of returning to campus and regaining a sense of normalcy in the coming weeks, and we will do everything we can to maintain our sense of community during this difficult period. Please know that your instructors have been working around the clock to make it feasible for you to continue your courses remotely. I am extremely thankful to the JMU faculty and staff for their unwavering dedication and creativity in making this happen, and ask for your patience as we work through this together. Given the scale of this transition, we expect that some challenges may arise. JMU Libraries has compiled [resources for students](https://guides.lib.jmu.edu/TemporaryRemoteTeaching_Learning/ForJMUStudents) to support your online learning success. We have asked all faculty members to design classes that can be as widely accessed as possible—for example, by limiting high-resolution video streaming that may strain home internet connections and the national grid. For summer sessions, JMU will be offering primarily online courses except for required clinical and experiential activities, which are still under review. Registration for summer classes has been delayed two weeks to April 6 and additional information on this is forthcoming. **On-campus residents will need to move out by March 29 or apply to stay.** In light of the national and statewide emergency declarations, residence halls will be closing for the remainder of the spring semester. Only students who have applied for and received housing exceptions will be permitted to stay. If you cannot go home, you must submit the [exception form](https://jmu.co1.qualtrics.com/jfe/form/SV_5haX3FxA41Q42k5) by March 20 at 5 p.m. Decisions will be communicated starting Thursday, March 19. For students not remaining in the residence halls, we have created a move-out schedule for the next two weekends. In an effort to comply with social distancing guidelines, we ask all families to adhere to this schedule if you plan to move out on the weekend. Residence halls are also available any time, day or night, during weekdays for students to move out. The schedule and additional information can be found [here](https://www.jmu.edu/orl/move-out/moveoutinfo.shtml). We recognize that many of you already traveled back to campus to collect some items, and we apologize for the inconvenience to you and your families to return again to fully move out. Please know that we are striving to make decisions in real time that are in the best interest of all members of our JMU community. **The university will offer refunds for housing and unused dining plans.** Students will receive a refund for housing and/or dining. Information on these refunds and/or credits is forthcoming, and we appreciate your patience as we evaluate financial obligations. **Spring commencement ceremonies have been postponed.** For all of you who are graduating, we recognize that these commencement ceremonies mark important milestones in your lives. Given the large scale of these events, we have made the difficult decision to postpone graduate and undergraduate commencement ceremonies (originally planned for May 7-9) to a later date. While we don’t have a new date yet, know that we are eager and excited to celebrate your accomplishments and years of hard work. While these in-person ceremonies will be delayed, please be assured that your degrees will be conferred on time in May, once final grades are received. Diplomas will be mailed this summer, in accordance to the standard university process. We will be back in touch soon with further information on commencement ceremonies for the Class of 2020. **Students are urged not to return to live in off-campus housing at this time.** For students considering returning to live in off-campus housing in Harrisonburg, please note that in-person access to university facilities and services is extremely limited. UREC and JMU Libraries are closed until further notice, and JMU Dining Services is operating on a limited schedule. Remember that in the unfortunate situation that you are asked to self-isolate or quarantine, you are, in most instances, likely better off doing so at home with family who can assist and support you. **All events on campus are cancelled, regardless of size, through May 15.** Based on guidance issued by the White House and the Governor of Virginia not to gather in groups of more than 10 people, all events on JMU’s campus, regardless of size, are cancelled through May 15. These restrictions include events at JMU that are not university-sponsored, including conferences and social gatherings. **JMU’s international programs have been suspended through Summer 2020.** We have made the decision to close all short-term summer study abroad programs, as well as our summer semester-long programs in London, Antwerp, Salamanca, Florence and Edinburgh. Global engagement continues to be at the heart of JMU’s mission to be a university engaged with the ideas of the world. We will be working with students affected by these closures to identify alternative summer course options and future study abroad opportunities. **I believe in you and I am wishing you the best in the days and weeks ahead.** Please keep checking jmu.edu/covid19 for the most up-to-date information. For questions on any of the information shared in this message, please email [covid19@jmu.edu](mailto:covid19@jmu.edu) so we can share your email with the appropriate person or office. As Dukes, you have always inspired me with your ability to overcome obstacles and to find ways to make a positive mark on the world. This is our time to stand together, to support and lift up one another with courage and compassion, and to write an incredible new chapter in the history of JMU that will be remembered by all of us for the rest of our lives. I wish you all the very best as you begin your online classes. We are here for you, and we believe in you. Let’s take care of ourselves and one another, knowing that a JMU education develops both the head and the heart. I look forward to seeing all of you sometime soon, and will continue to be in touch. I look forward to seeing all of you sometime soon, and will continue to be in touch.

post,Is this a stupid reason to ask a professor if he can make room for me in his class?,"Is this a stupid reason to ask a professor if he can make room for me in his class? I don't wanna talk about it too much, but basically a group of guys at jmu have been stalking me and trying to hurt me, and after talking to the police and jmu administration, they've all said that I should transfer to another college for my safety. The school I want to transfer to is uva (pls don't hate me). They have a bunch of transfer course requirements to complete before transferring, and there's this one class I need to take to fulfill two of the requirements. The thing is, the class and the waitlist is full. I know I can ask the professor if he can let me in the class, but I feel like it might be weird/offensive because my reason for wanting to be in his class is to leave jmu and transfer to another school...what should I do?",2019-11-07 12:18:54,48
comment,Is this a stupid reason to ask a professor if he can make room for me in his class?,"I'm baffled by this. If you were told by officials that the best thing to do is to transfer for your safety, then there is clear evidence that any student involved in this behavior is responsible for violating policy J16-100 in the student handbook and needs to be paying a visit to OSARP. If this isn't happening because you don't feel comfortable moving forward with that, then I can respect your decision, but if it isn't happening because university folks are discouraging it then that is absolutely wrong. I've sat on plenty of accountability boards and this is ridiculous.",2019-11-07 13:20:28,47

If they're going to let you into class, it's a good idea to let them know the reasons you want to override in, especially if there's the possibility for a safety issue.

I used to tell my story and struggles openly, then when the country became hostile towards immigrants I suddenly stopped. Because of fear, persecution from our fellow classmates, negative thoughts, etc... But lately I’ve been easing myself into sharing bits of it because someone you’ll change a life or perspectives, hopefully for the best. At the moment you have a support system, a community, JMU. Believe it or not your professors care, maybe not all but the majority do. I openly told my professors of my case and if I ever needed a reference letter, If they could help out and write one. They said yes, some gave me additional information and led me to “specialist” on the subject matter so I can get better resources. They also said “if you need anything else please let me know, and keep me in the loop.” I was amazed by how understanding they were and gives me hope that everything will be okay. I have people to rely on, a support system, JMU. Use all the resources available, don’t be afraid and keep fighting for what you believe.",2019-11-07 12:59:06,15

Voting is easier than ever, you just need to fill out that digital form requesting a mail-in ballot ASAP.

post,This is getting out of control.,"This is getting out of control. We now have roughly 400 cases between on-campus and off-campus, and JMU is trying to hide the fact by changing their dashboard to remove relevant graphs and hide the data. Yesterday there were only 30 positives on campus, and today there are 100 with a positivity rating of 12% since July first (I believe someone claimed it was 25 since the start of move-in however). And this is in addition to - * Social distancing being near impossible in any building, just look at any dining hall * Overcrowded in-person classes with people sitting on the floors at times * No punishment for breaking guidelines (covid related and school-related) * Parties happening all the time with no mask and much more than 10 people (And I know some of the RAs are doing their best, but its obvious some of the RAs don't have a single sh\*t to give) * Rumors of the health center denying testing to exposed individuals to artificially slow down the case number rising * Denying important covid related data to local newspapers * ""Cautious opitmism"" People are generally considering VCU to be in a bad spot right now with roughly 200 cases, and we now have double that. In the first week, we have 400 confirmed cases (but there's for sure more than that). Remember when everyone freaked out at Alabama having 500 in the first week? Yeah, that's us now. I'm so disgusted with how JMU is handling this. And of course they're gonna try and drag this out until the 15th so they can have our money.

post,"""Cautious Optimism"" new email from Alger - HAHAHAHAHAHAHA","""Cautious Optimism"" new email from Alger - HAHAHAHAHAHAHA Dear JMU Family, Welcome to another year at James Madison University, one that obviously has started unlike any other in the 112-year history of the institution. In years past, when I have extended this greeting, I have reveled in the spirit of possibility and all that we can accomplish together when we are united. While each of us continues to make sacrifices during this pandemic, my determination to kindle this same spirit is still strong. The entire JMU faculty and staff will remain steadfast in working to uphold continued academic progress for JMU students—however the situation calls for it. Here at JMU, we are motivated by the start of a new academic year and the inherent promise and hopefulness in committing ourselves to learning, teaching and working—despite the inevitable uncertainty. The work of our students, faculty and staff to get the semester started on time with in-person, hybrid and online classes has required great flexibility, commitment and resilience. This past Wednesday, which was the first day of classes, dozens of volunteers from every division at the university [stood at building doorways across campus](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__emclick.imodules.com_ls_click-3Fupn-3Dw3rtLLOBBsx2UYJQqVZ7UmCgXCCRKQofc4YzU3mELwHu-2D2FeBnbjHGqLqZq9FCzabLIHToZBrrXs594ljavmMcVXVWtZUbdssVbWBWz0D5chy2i28kKcjjj8NB-2D2Bu3iOYdiytvt-5FfuC8-2D2FUBqhKVHdL4f-2D2Fca3qJt-2D2Ft2F-2D2FRYej3nDn-2D2Bq-2D2FizRoixRhaYGS9k9SeoNHkSxUlnh7F-2D2BTz1G9GmL0lHyWcyvE2e81T8bVKfsSBNuc-2D2BaxuVe8PGFNIZhsGaPsTmQrIdBUURht8UWiV18rHOWOCyGrcoQfTbwYix2jxO2UXP7BgWOw01RcvgGdHi5nrrvHwCaVu-2D2BenLXkOhlhJK-2D2F1kJzGJbubPEV0QP4ivYolvCPrKI1V6CEurVmBGaGJ4258-2D2BtOj-2D2FPfYCwSDgJt8uKo9ettj989UMlrARFyF3CY1Qd8rI7ys5n6kLJjij-2D2FtejD-2D2BHORoKWRbtMp-2D2Bo2Xtr3QpymXOdmh8UvyLH1Ah5Jsg4UD5kf8ltXOw9GnBTmrOGBRpBwOJlLTqzdhzSma12VzCfh2Xcpc2hcj8riIFAT-2D2F9P7LZlhDFDa9CbG9DibwVWN2xjDULYbBSP2TM9-2D2FJgmk-2D2F0oRHXZQvAVvVposiph8-2D2FOFIjbu6Y8Lu3vHimtqQ1aFbak9aXMnknVIN4WgjmJUjXkfVD4pxQ-2D3D-2D3D&d=DwMFaQ&c=RWKzQL7PIkYKzsYSjZn54yrN72ooGPhHwUXdJ0S2Irw&r=yENlR_qM-FJ--47INu_Dn260ZfCCU6WW_hTYZ0MgJUQ&m=t6x3MKrc9OyEobmQkMv0rRVga-Q9eamMzUKrKAo7GAs&s=3UhcQt8oroI29ofPoFa2CniHIT9GGGQfgU5ylgs28uY&e=) wearing “Stop the Spread” T-shirts and handing out masks in case a student didn’t have one. **We didn’t need to hand out a single mask, because every student was already wearing one.** It was an uplifting display of care for the common good and love for JMU. Despite these unified efforts, our tireless medical staff at the University Health Center continue to see a rise in positive cases among the student body. We are closely monitoring the spread of the virus and are prepared to take action if necessary. We continue to hear questions from all constituencies asking for reassurance. It is, of course, completely justifiable to be concerned especially when—as we all deal, together, with something none of us has ever experienced—interpreting epidemiologic data is so nuanced and dynamic. The university’s leadership is in constant contact with medical experts, and together we are looking at many different factors each day. Thus **in any given day, the number of new positive cases is not a singularly determinant factor in our decision making, even though that is often the focus in media and social media reports.** So that we all have a common understanding of how to interpret these data points, please visit the Virginia Department of Health’s [website](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__emclick.imodules.com_ls_click-3Fupn-3Dw3rtLLOBBsx2UYJQqVZ7UmCgXCCRKQofc4YzU3mELwHu-2D2FeBnbjHGqLqZq9FCzabL3t8LbeOkVrXsgSIFOM7v8VU7hsdzw5n8oUFhrLHtdR-2D2Bm7fp2L3rt7w3bRQOT4IiLvGmi-5FfuC8-2D2FUBqhKVHdL4f-2D2Fca3qJt-2D2Ft2F-2D2FRYej3nDn-2D2Bq-2D2FizRoixRhaYGS9k9SeoNHkSxUlnh7F-2D2BTz1G9GmL0lHyWcyvE2e81T8bVKfsSBNuc-2D2BaxuVe8PGFNIZhsGaPsTmQrIdBUURht8UWiV18rHOWOCyGrcoQfTbwYix2jxO2UXP7BgWOw01RcvgGdHi5nrrvHwCaVu-2D2BenLXkOhlhJK-2D2F1kJzGJbubPEV0QP4ivYolvCPrKI1V6CEurVmBGaGJ4258-2D2BtOj-2D2FPfYCwSDgJt8uKo9ettj989UMlrARFyF3CY1Qd8rI7ys5n6kLJjij-2D2FtejD-2D2BHORoKWRbtMp-2D2Bo2Xtr3QpymXOdmh8UvyLH1Ah5Jsg4UD5kf8kzZe3WBjP93kLycLIGDPwax3o1xrTvcuwPpvgHDLVzEPU5AQX4UN-2D2F5NXS54gqOmUXQqceMmcyGrwtaRL15vzL8npEENVrOgYFzFTdruDrysM7Lau3vJ3DhzsA2-2D2BXul3CbhJEoQVIjTczwnMG-2D2Bexe4nlwY5b5fP-2D2FxvUnPqCFCrT0g-2D3D-2D3D&d=DwMFaQ&c=RWKzQL7PIkYKzsYSjZn54yrN72ooGPhHwUXdJ0S2Irw&r=yENlR_qM-FJ--47INu_Dn260ZfCCU6WW_hTYZ0MgJUQ&m=t6x3MKrc9OyEobmQkMv0rRVga-Q9eamMzUKrKAo7GAs&s=CxMS0Sj23S4bLrEaMete9SCWbalUCj1tPcoOT8Ft4Mc&e=) on this topic.

This new class of first-year students is 4,634 strong from 1,111 high schools across the Commonwealth of Virginia, 41 states and 11 countries. They, too, have experienced many sacrifices, many uncertainties and ongoing upheaval in their lives, but they are here, on our campus and ready to make their mark on Madison. While move-in was successful and many staff and volunteers participated in the welcoming, because of the need to physically distance, our new Dukes and their families could not witness the exuberant JMU spirit typically on full display during move-in with swarms of smiling student volunteers helping to lug their belongings into the residence halls. We are also so thankful for our returning students, many of whom had to take on additional responsibilities when they moved back to their homes to finish out the Spring 2020 semester. Many of those students, in true JMU fashion, assisted their communities in a time of great need while continuing to finish their coursework in a whole new way. Throughout the past several months, our nation and the world have also been grappling with issues related to race relations and systemic racism that have had an especially difficult impact on individuals within our Black community. **We know that this has been painful for you, and that there is much work to be done.** We are in conversation with Black leaders among our student body and Black faculty and staff members about the issues of systemic racism and inequity. To that end, the work of our new Task Force on Racial Equity has already begun, and more details can be found [here](https://urldefense.proofpoint.com/v2/url?u=http-3A__emclick.imodules.com_ls_click-3Fupn-3Dw3rtLLOBBsx2UYJQqVZ7UmCgXCCRKQofc4YzU3mELwHu-2D2FeBnbjHGqLqZq9FCzabLTkZ7I0E-2D2F6Z-2D2F3lGghaysUvUBtCT-2D2FAVc0GqjG83ICnTau2fDDh94pOv1WD4OAA0nIP0DUI-5FfuC8-2D2FUBqhKVHdL4f-2D2Fca3qJt-2D2Ft2F-2D2FRYej3nDn-2D2Bq-2D2FizRoixRhaYGS9k9SeoNHkSxUlnh7F-2D2BTz1G9GmL0lHyWcyvE2e81T8bVKfsSBNuc-2D2BaxuVe8PGFNIZhsGaPsTmQrIdBUURht8UWiV18rHOWOCyGrcoQfTbwYix2jxO2UXP7BgWOw01RcvgGdHi5nrrvHwCaVu-2D2BenLXkOhlhJK-2D2F1kJzGJbubPEV0QP4ivYolvCPrKI1V6CEurVmBGaGJ4258-2D2BtOj-2D2FPfYCwSDgJt8uKo9ettj989UMlrARFyF3CY1Qd8rI7ys5n6kLJjij-2D2FtejD-2D2BHORoKWRbtMp-2D2Bo2Xtr3QpymXOdmh8UvyLH1Ah5Jsg4UD5kf8nSrsb6adZfcv0AjMiV2pchbJxovdUiCe-2D2BC0jBSHv-2D2BnGyt-2D2BaKAubN-2D2BSD-2D2FM3NwjqngXCdVpZW3-2D2B-2D2FSKuSdY15EY0rjbeAX4nkt47992-2D2FHvwVtZpe7w3RbOtW1g9IpKVtg1bF-2D2BTcc6Rep8MwjMWcckLYLAPPxyitIqRxO4ZZKbbKRFtQ-2D3D-2D3D&d=DwMFaQ&c=RWKzQL7PIkYKzsYSjZn54yrN72ooGPhHwUXdJ0S2Irw&r=yENlR_qM-FJ--47INu_Dn260ZfCCU6WW_hTYZ0MgJUQ&m=t6x3MKrc9OyEobmQkMv0rRVga-Q9eamMzUKrKAo7GAs&s=nxmqKc_QtG9YzwrDh-QxWwNybTNa8ccyzgdmZ6neYFI&e=).

OK. > **The data we share is an underrepresentation of COVID-19 in Virginia.** > We know that the number of cases we have on record is an underrepresentation of the true burden for several reasons. Some underrepresentation is because testing for SARS-CoV-2 might not be available for the infected person.. Another factor is that not everyone will need to see a doctor for COVID-19. The World Health Organization (WHO) published a very detailed [report](https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/who-china-joint-mission-on-covid-19-final-report.pdf) about the outbreak of COVID-19 in China and found that 80% of cases were mild or moderate.

Share all the (definitely real and in no way fake) fun facts you’ve heard from your time on campus!,"Everyone let’s share interesting (totally real and in no way fake) facts about JMU’s illustrious history! Share all the (definitely real and in no way fake) fun facts you’ve heard from your time on campus! Here are some of my favorite JMU fun facts! E-hall similar to D-hall stands for “Eating hall” because you eat food there. Bridgeforth stadium is named for the fourth bridge built from main campus to east campus that collapsed back in 1995 killing two motorists. The fourth bridge was designed by JMU engineering students as a capstone project. Sadly they received an F on their assignment and all became business majors instead. The current bridge is the 5th bridge finished in 1997 to replace the old one. Godwin Hall is named after the Celtic word for “goblin” leading students to suspect that there may be something sinister lying in the building’s basement. The “death stairs” got their name after an exhausted student fell face first from the highest step, tumbled down halfway, landed on the railroad tracks that intersect the stairway, and got hit by a passing freight train. The incident happened back in 2001. Contrary to many students belief the person in question actually survived and had their tuition paid in full. That person later graduated and was later instated as the University’s current president. Their name was John Alger. ISAT stands for “Intense Student Academic Trauma” which is why the conjoined science buildings on east campus are known as “ISAT” Wilson Hall was named by a student poll back in the 2000. Students, still excited after seeing the hit 2000 Movie “castaway” named the hall Wilson to commemorate the famous volley ball from the film that comforted Tom Hanks during the film. To this day every December 7th, students will leave volley balls inside Wilson Hall to commemorate the film’s release The Student Success Center used to be a Hot Topic before being purchased by the University back in 2005 Carrier Library was named after a former JMU President. Mr. Chips was started by an extremely friendly food vendor who used to stand in the center of campus selling random bags of chips purchased from the local convenience store. He constantly asked students to call him “Mr Chips” an too this day nobody knows his real name although some suspect it might’ve been Tim. D-hub isn’t actually a dinning hall on campus, it’s actually just what students used to call D-hall. Older students just pretend they’re different dinning locations to confuse freshman. Don’t fall for their lies!!! Eagle hall was named after the Eagle of a former JMU President. Mr Chips was initially designed to be 7 stories tall but, being unable to secure the correct permits, the owner could only build 1 story. JMU’s mascot isn’t a bulldog, but actually the Duke of Worshtishire’s rare albino pug. This is why JMU’s students are known as “the Dukes” Memorial Hall was named after a memorial, built in honor of a former JMU President. The schools fight song was actually written by James Madison back in 1787 after attending the constitutional convention. In the original work he wrote “If an institution should achieve a level of academic excellence such that my name be prescribed to it, let its students recite this chant for the expressed purpose of getting HYPE AS FUCK” -James Madison Harrisonburg is named after Nathaniel Harris who settled the town back in 1893 to try and create his own independent nation. His settlement lasted for 6 months before his government was dissolved forcefully by a government Militia. His state was re-annexed but the city still bears his name. Brickhouse was named after a former JMU President Newman lake is named after Ted Newman who went missing 50 years ago. his body was never found but rumor has it that the dangerous pollutants in the lake have reanimated his corpse. The University to this day dumps over 70 gallons of blue Gatorade laced with chloroform into the lake on a semi-regular basis in an attempt to keep ted Newman’s reanimated corpse sedated. This is what gives the lake it’s Caspian blue coloration.",2020-06-16 12:58:03,49

comment,Who here feel stupid af?,"261 was the hardest class I’ve ever taken. I got the pleasure of taking it twice because I got a 69% my first time taking it, but even the second time through with a professor that I enjoyed quite a bit more, I found it to be very difficult. Everything I did in c felt hacky and gross. There’s also not a lot of the fun logical problem solving that I enjoy about computer science. a lot of it is just stuff you have to know somehow. The book is a bore, and provides so much extraneous information that it’s hard to tell what is important and will be on the tests and quizzes. My first time taking it the prof told us to go teach ourselves c, which was messed up. After learning like 6 other languages, I can tell you with confidence that c is one difficult language to learn, god forbid it is the second language you learn after java. I have enjoyed every other cs class way more (361 2ndish place on my difficulty scale so get ready for that lol). I’m no genius, but I’m not a complete idiot.

I’ve read some past posts for suggestions (Bella Luna, Clementine, Billy Jack’s, Jack Brown’s, Benny Sorrentino’s, The Golden Pony), which I’ll definitely check out. When I was in school, Dave’s Taverna was a go-to spot for lunch, dinner, and late night. Gyros, homemade chips, tzatziki, and, if you were short on cash, egg and cheese pitas. It looks like Dave’s closed down and I’m looking for something similar. Not necessarily Greek food, but a popular place that serves something unique. Maybe it’s one of the places listed above or another one not yet mentioned. I read the owner of Dave’s now owns Francesco’s in Bridgewater but I’m looking for a place in Harrisonburg.

comment,Dave’s Taverna alternative,"Try Ciro's (the elkton location is also a great spot a bit fancier if you care about that kind of thing and their menu as a whole is larger as well for pasta mains) Brothers (in the Luigi's spot - RIP) best vodka sauce in town (made often by a Hounduran no less) The Sub Station is a VERY random but great spot in the old Waffle House on the south end of town - mexican and hoagies. Yeah it just works somehow A&A kebab near EMU is a gem - absolutely nothing to look at, but I've found those can be some of the best spots. Authentic and totally reasonably priced Taste of Thai has been an HBurg staple for ages and has expanded to have their whole building. Still great food, lunch deal is a great one. For a tour of downtown: (as I think you're already well aware) Grab a messy (and delicious) burger at Jack Browns, sticky nugs at Billy Jacks and roasted bacon maple Brussel sprouts from Jimmy Madison's.

post,U/macaronironi posts about the 4 bedroom in the altitude apartments is BS,U/macaronironi posts about the 4 bedroom in the altitude apartments is BS I’ve seen this user posting saying “4 bedroom apartment in the altitude for a one bedroom price”. This is false. It is one person trying to sublease one bedroom of a 4 person unit. I had a feeling that $1000 a month for a 4 bedroom place at The Altitude was too good to be true. Just posting so nobody takes the bait and thinks they are getting a 4 bedroom unit. I suggest mods delete his posts as they are 100% false advertising and misleading.,2020-11-10 16:47:30,51

comment,JMU a Contender to Make College Football Playoff,Pull back on the reins a little bit. JMU played only one good half of football in two games before the UNC game.

comment,JMU a Contender to Make College Football Playoff,They still need to play a lot better. Let’s not get ahead of ourselves. Allowing the opposing team to score 50 points can’t be ignored. Defense is going to have to shut that down if they want to go all the way.,2024-09-23 08:48:01,8

comment,Youngkin's strict new teleworking policy will affect JMU employees and may result in a wave of resignations,"This is going to be a mess. With the climate survey showing that both faculty and staff are unhappy about compensation and feeling valued, this will only add fuel to the fire. Especially with this not applying to faculty members this also has the potential to drive a further wedge between faculty and staff than what already exists. There has been a huge amount of turnover since the pandemic started and the strict telework rules that JMU had were cited in a large number of the exit interviews. This will just exacerbate that. JMU was just starting to loosen it up for the agency when this happens.",2022-05-06 09:56:46,30

I grew up (and attended college) in Florida. Over time, the Republican politicians made education (at all levels) less attractive to work for, less creative, more dependent upon centrally (read: politically) created rules, etc... Through time it drove out many of the best employees, which was exactly the point. The next election cry from the Republican party was always ""Look how awful government is at everything."" Meanwhile, they were the ones in control and knee-capping the budgets. To me, this just looks like a more subtle version of that same game.",2022-05-09 20:28:42,3

I love my job and what I do and the people I work with (seriously, my coworkers are awesome).

I know not everyone is in that position and I feel really bad for them, but I did take my job for some of the intangible benefits rather than just salary (and WFH has become one of them). And yes, I do know that some of my coworkers would leave for greener pastures. It's the reason why our department pushed so hard for the full-time work from home - it's pretty standard in the industry, so it's hard to stay competitive when you don't have it.",2022-05-06 14:58:06,8

post,Fall Schedule 2.0 Questions Answered/Alger's Email Summarized,"Fall Schedule 2.0 Questions Answered/Alger's Email Summarized So, as my adviser explained, Fall Schedule 2.0 is basically an overhaul to the class schedule for the upcoming semester. They are changing some class times just to attempt to ensure the best practices are followed given the COVID-19 situation. You are NOT being un-enrolled, you DO NOT have to re-enroll! There might be a case where a section might disappear and be cancelled, that will mostly be one day classes or unique situations. MOST changes will be rolled out by today, June 10th. They will all be finalized by July 21st. Please, PAY ATTENTION to the Student Center for updates. It appears open enrollment may begin on July 21st, if not, then August 3rd. No changes to your schedule until open enrollment, sorry returning students. However, those changes can be made from open enrollment day up until the add/drop deadline of September 4th. First year students will be able to enroll from June 15th until June 19th. You guys will review your schedules with your advisers and attend virtual springboards from June 22-July 17. If anyone has any questions, feel free to inbox me! Also, they are advising students to wear masks, maintain social distancing, etc. in the Fall. Please follow these guidelines as best as possible. I had this virus along with my sister and grandpa. Due to my asthma and kidney disease, this virus sucked. I have been out of work and in bed for months. I cannot even carry my 1 year old nephew up the steps. My sister is still having complications. My grandfather passed away due to the virus' complications. He just turned 70 in April. I'm not here to soapbox you, but I do want you to know that this thing is real and you do no wanting it getting to your friends or family members just because you would not wear a mask or not go to a basement party at Tri-Delt. Respect the drip you guys :)",2020-06-10 02:00:26,48

Like I feel in President Jim’s first few months I’ve seen more of him on social media compared to my 2 years at JMU with Alger?

comment,JMU President,I’m also an alum so I haven’t been following their socials recently but I always got the sense that Alger was pretty introverted and was happy to let Tim Miller be the “face” of JMU for students and parents while Alger focused more on fundraising and other external duties.

comment,JMU President,"I got to meet Jim over the summer at a small event. He’s very outgoing and truly loves his job. He talked about how his favorite thing is meeting with the students. Before taking the job he went around campus and pretended to be a parent of a prospective student and asked kids “why JMU”. He talked about how impressed he was with the students he spoke to. How they were so enthusiastic and didn’t grumble when he asked or act annoyed about taking off their headphones. He talked about how he loved the “hold the door” mantra, etc. He also met with something like 30 CEOs in 30 days. He wants to bring a lot of events to JMU and partnerships to help fund things like construction of new buildings. For example, he doesn’t believe in spending all that money on the stadium to have it sit idle most the time etc. He wants to hold concerts there. At first glance he seemed like just another typical older white male president, but after the event I left feeling very impressed and excited for JMUs future under his watch.

post,Students should absolutely be given the option to go 100% virtual.,"Students should absolutely be given the option to go 100% virtual. The reason that we’re in person in the first place is because the school is almost as broke as the students. Being in person with mandatory attendance and punishing students for getting tested is the most ridiculous cash-grab ever. I guarantee administration knows what they’re doing and they’re just trying to hold out until the refund deadline like they did Spring 2020. By giving students the option to go virtual, they still make their money on tuition and those who want to be in person can be.

comment,Students should absolutely be given the option to go 100% virtual.,"From what I've seen there are no accommodations for immunocompromised students (that are easily findable) and nothing for those with increased health risks. COVID can definitely be spread on campus when those students that go out come into class and mingle with students that don't go out. Omicron may be milder but it's one transmissable. That's the trade-off. Plus even if the symptoms are mild I personally don't want COVID. My friends who caught it are still dealing with long-term symptoms of Omicron. One can't be in the cold or they get hives (allergic to the cold now apparently and it may last around a year), another has headaches often and has a hard time sleeping. Some students also CANNOT get vaccinated - see immunocompromised students above - and some older individuals and children cannot get vaccinated. You can be a carrier, you can have a breakthrough infection, you can be asymptomatic if you're vaccinated still. At this point it's not just unvaccinated individuals getting sick - the virus is mutating with every variant making it easier and easier for people to be infected (all of my friends were fully vaxxed with boosters and still got COVID) Also vaccination isn't a requirement for staff. They say that in Stop the Spread. Masks aren't enforced like they should be with so many people wearing it incorrectly and some just not wearing one. I haven't seen anyone called out about it personally either. JMU said they'd make changes to ensure a safe semester and has done nothing like that so far. At most I'm having professors tell me it's required to wear a N95 or surgical mask instead of cost,effective cloth masks - and this is at our expense. So we won't be allowed to go to class anyways - why not make it online.",2022-01-19 01:17:06,7
comment,Students should absolutely be given the option to go 100% virtual.,I’m vaxxed. Vaccines are not required. Boosters are merely suggested.

comment,Students should absolutely be given the option to go 100% virtual.,"Last semester, a lot of students apparently reported being overly-stressed with the entire ""returning back to normal"" thing. Wearing masks in classes several hours a day, the fear of catching COVID, dealing with family and friends who've gotten sick, managing workload, not being able to really party or go out, etc....it puts a lot of mental strain on students in addition to the existing stress of going to college. Going online allows a lot more flexibility and reduces at least some of these stresses.",2022-01-18 17:09:27,7

comment,Students should absolutely be given the option to go 100% virtual.,"Well if everyone is forced to go online there are a ton of negatives. A lesser education for many courses, severe mental health issues for many students, lack of structure for students with ADHD and executive dysfunction, lack of access to JMU resources that you pay tuition for, etc. We are over 90% vaccinated. If there’s a virtual option, that’s nice in theory but not always doable. For large lecture formats there should be a zoom in option, but for some smaller upper level major/minor courses it would be difficult to ask professors to design all their classes to work for in person and online at the same time. I do however think that students should be encouraged to get tested, professors should be forced to have a covid flexible attendance policy, and students in unique positions (autoimmune condition and can’t get vaxxed for example) should have ODS accommodations that force professors to provide an online class content delivery in such instances. In terms of hardly wear masks, if you’re talking about on campus I strongly disagree. Off campus yes, but that’s most places in America right now.",2022-01-18 23:30:35,0

comment,Students should absolutely be given the option to go 100% virtual.,"I agree for a lot but also want to note that, 1. If you're basing the 90% on the Stop the Spread site - they're using data visualization manipulation to make it seem less bad. That 90% is a mix of partially or fully vaccinated students/staff (partial vaccination is not as effective for covid) 2. None of my classes have given accommodations for immunocompromised students or for students with increased health risks 3. People may wear masks but they are not enforced from what I've seen. Especially with the number of people wearing it below their nose or not at all. Some classes are mandating surgical and N95 masks as well and those aren't as easily accessible as reusable cloth masks - and from what I've seen this is at the expense of the student. For lower income students (almost all of us lol) who aren't able to afford these masks how do they come to class? If they don't enforce it then it's unfair to the students who bought the masks. If they do, then these students are unable to come to class because of their finances. JMU needs to get it straight and be better.",2022-01-19 01:05:58,4

Def fair point, we don’t really have access to full data, but I think it’s fair to say that JMU as a population has a much higher percentage vaccinated than the general public. 2. I think this is absolutely crazy and should be against the Americans with Disabilities Act 3. JMU or government should provide masks, although in comparison to textbooks/calculators/meal plans/parking passes, masks are a pretty cheap college expense. Also while it should be better enforced, I think mask usage probably varies a lot by major tbh which is probably influencing your perception of % of ppl wearing masks.

post,Final Grade ruined by 1 mistake,"Final Grade ruined by 1 mistake This spring I took CIS 221 with Shawn Lough as a fresman and overall I did decent in the class. I had an A-. At least until I made a mistake. During the final exam which was weighted very heavily, I forgot to sign the honor code at the end as as a result, my professor gave me a zero on the entire exam and it dropped my whole grade to a C-. When my professor told me about it, I apologized and asked him if I could still sign it and he refused. He also said a 75 is a “respectable” grade so I shouldn’t have anything to worry about as if that’s not a 2 in a 4.0 scale and didn’t drop my entire gpa by more than 0.2. It did say above the signature box that if you do not sign, it is an automatic zero so I feel like the dean will definitely take the professor's side. Is there anything else that can be done? Edit: The dean told me to email the teacher's superviser. the superviser said grades are the decison of the professor unless they treated me different than another student so she can't do anything.

comment,Final Grade ruined by 1 mistake,If it was at the beginning then how did you miss it? The pledge is typically at the beginning so you are not going to miss it when you write you name. It is important to pledge you work when possible. For the student you pledging your work is you stating that you did not knowingly commit any academic dishonesty on that assignment. You are also saying that you understand and accept that you WILL be expelled if it is discovered that you did commit academic dishonesty on this assignment. This means if you do have honor charges filed against you then your personal integrity will be considered. The pledge is important for the professor if they file honor charges against you because you pledged that you have completed this assignment without any academic dishonesty. If they file honor charges against you and the investigation shows you committed academic dishonesty then they also have evidence that you perjured yourself with the pledge. This makes it much easier to justify harsher punishments given for academic dishonesty. If you did not sign the pledge and committed academic dishonesty then you only committed academic dishonesty. If you did sign the pledge and committed academic dishonesty then you also committed perjury in addition to academic dishonesty. If someone else did the exam for you and they did not sign the pledge then you both only committed academic dishonesty. If they did the exam for you and did sign the pledge then you both committed academic dishonesty but they also committed fraudulent misrepresentation.,2025-05-18 19:22:09,-1

comment,MRDs left out of the yearbook,Yeah it’s pretty irritating. If there isn’t a dedicated section/specific story about the MRDs in the yearbook we just don’t get any pages at all. Which is ESPECIALLY irritating this year because we literally went to Italy for new years to play for the Pope in January!! For our 50th season anniversary!! That’s like the best opportunity for a yearbook story EVER and they didn’t even know about it I assume even though it was advertised at liters every. Single. Home game. In the fall.

comment,MRDs left out of the yearbook,"Excuse me if I'm being frank, but it's probably because MRD's are basically the strange people all accumulated into one organization.

This serious increase in violent crime in that specific area really needs to be looked at. Back about 15 years it was just party central with the small criminal activity that goes along with that. But shootings are complete ridiculous and HPD needs to stop fucking around with kind of glossing over JMU hubs as just college kids being college kids.

comment,"Hey um what is going on? “There is an emergency on JMU campus, seek shelter immediately” just blared through my window. Anyone have any idea?","I have a story from when I lived in Fox that I forgot about until this thread. So in 2015 I lived in the top row of the privately owned townhomes (green doors). All units in that row except for 1 were occupied by students except the last one next to mine, it was occupied by some SKETCHY townies. Well that year they had a Halloween party and invited us over, but we were having our own party a few houses down so only my 2 roommates went to check it out. It was a big party but it was all 30+ year old black and Hispanic people (not an issue, but obviously JMU feels mostly white so it was clear this was not a JMU party). All their drinks had a cost: $1 for keg beer, $2 for a shot, or $3 for the “magic drink” which contained god knows what drugs. At some point in the party, a guy went berserk and just started sucker punching people in the face, I think about 10 people. Literally if you made eye contact with him he would just storm up to you and knock you out. He did this in the parking lot on his way out as well and a guy I know had his jaw wired shut for a few months because of it, and literally had no interaction with the guy beforehand. To top the night off, a guy was carrying a passed out girl on his shoulder through the party trying to leave (not rescuing her, the exact opposite). Out front, there was a huge crowd of people and instead of just going around the crowd, he wanted to go right through but people wouldn’t move, so he just took out his gun and fired a few shots into the air which obviously scattered everyone. Police immediately swarmed the place like a swat team, with dogs and everything while our party a few houses down had to squeeze everyone inside and just wait. By far the sketchiest thing that happened on Devon in the 3 years I lived there.",2022-10-16 10:07:45,8

post,Disabled Duke who needs help moving out of Harrisonburg this weekend,Disabled Duke who needs help moving out of Harrisonburg this weekend Edit: I have back and joint problems due to autoimmune disease so moving is excruciating. Hence my appeal for help. All my friends are gone from the area after graduation or out of town u til school year is back. I live in a furnished apartment (no furniture needs to be movies) in one of the student apartments in Harrisonburg and leaving Sunday. All maid services are totally full. I’m actually moving back home to my country because of my poor health and being lonely here in the United States without family after graduating and working in Harrisonburg/DC/Texas for decade. So I kind of will fit my life in one to two luggages. I just need help throwing everything away and cleaning up everything that I don’t need which won’t involve furniture since the furniture belongs to the complex. I tried doing myself but I have rheumatic and neurological conditions that make it impossible for me to lift. Looking to see if anyone in town before the end of July can help me throw away everything and clean with me so I can have only one or two suitcases worth of stuff ready to go on my trip back home overseas. Happy to pay with some cash or food. I appreciate it,2022-07-27 18:22:23,45

Seriously a months long ordeal to go in there and challenge it and deal with the OSARP dweebs over what was a super super simple matter. I had to gather “evidence” (aka ask my friend to email them saying he let me borrow it) go to a meeting with an OSARP guy to review my case and confirm I wanted to challenge it, deal with OSARP rescheduling my hearing twice, go in and have a “trial” type deal with like 5 people there to hear me say I didn’t steal my friends pass, and then go to another meeting where it was determined I now have to do 8 hours of a mentor ship program with OSARP.

comment,"Following the model outlined by JMU, I suggest that Fall tuition and fees be reduced by 27.5% as a result of students current debt obligations","So keep in mind the point of the class was to identify the MVP and decide the cost vs benefit of various add on features. The point that professor made is that about 9% (I think it was 8% when i took the class) of what we pay JMU is used to fund some financial aid programs. Those funds are then basically paid to JMU themselves. It is a 9% expense for something that does not create as large of value as other things. I am on the fence about considering it bloat because on one had it improves access to JMU but on the other hand I had to take out a extra $5K in loans to cover it over my time at JMU. From a pure cost-benefit analysis approach for the majority stakeholder it is bloat. The analytical answer and the emotional answer are exact opposites of each other in this case which turns this into a ethical reasoning problem. It does not help the the public budgets are kinda obfuscated when compared to other filings. I am not sure if the internal reports are the same way,",2020-04-02 18:51:55,2

post,Other side of the sexual assault debate,"Other side of the sexual assault debate EDIT: To clear up confusion, the incident occurred in Florida, which is why Florida criminal law is relevant instead of Virginia law. Wording of the JMU Handbook: ""James Madison University **reserves the right** to hold students accountable for certain types of off-campus behavior. Disciplinary action will result if a student’s behavior compromises the educational atmosphere or mission of the institution. Examples of such off-campus behavior would include, but not be limited to, **crimes** of violence, **sexual assault** and/or alcohol or drug violations, as determined by the Office of Student Accountability & Restorative Practices."" Relevant Florida Statute: 794.011 Sexual Battery- “Sexual battery” means **oral, anal, or vaginal penetration** by, or union with, the sexual organ of another or the anal or vaginal penetration of another by any other object; however, sexual battery does not include an act done for a bona fide medical purpose. Florida does not have a relevant statute against sexual assault other than sexual battery, **which does not include groping**. Groping **against one's consent** would fall under ordinary battery under FL law. This likely shines light on why sexual assault charges were not pursued. The video (which I have seen) shows the men groping the girl. It does not show any penetration, and there is no evidence (other than their own testimony) of penetration before or after the video. And to be honest, whether ""consent"" to be groped was given is arguable. She willingly took her top off, joked around with the men about her breasts, offered no resistance when groped (and I understand that not resisting =/= consent), and did not show any signs of discomfort other than at the end of the video saying that it probably was not okay to do. Does inviting a man (who, mind you, allegedly was a recent/current sexual partner) into a room, removing your top to show your breasts, and flirting with the other members of the room not constitute some sort of consent? Granted, we do not know whether or not any of those men had sex with her afterwards. And, yes, it was a scummy thing to videotape the incident and share it. Regardless, the media has propped this issue up to sound a lot worse than it actually was. I do agree that the student handbook likely should be amended to allow for stricter punishments for certain crimes committed by JMU's students. However, would you condone expelling a student for ordinary battery off-campus? Consider, once again, that this was not a case of sexual battery, per Florida statute, but rather misdemeanor battery. Thus, any off-campus scuffle in Virginia that results in misdemeanor charges being sought (think drunken fight at an off-campus housing location) could theoretically result in expulsion under this precedent. Worse even is the fact that charges **were never pursued**, so these students would have been expelled for a **misdemeanor battery** action that **had never even been charged as such** in another state. Just felt like throwing this out there.",2014-06-23 15:26:56,42

comment,Other side of the sexual assault debate,"My opinion? Whether or not she consented to the groping, was intoxicated, was ""asking for it,"" or anything else that constitutes blame, this became a definitive case of sexual harassment as soon as she was unknowingly videotaped and it was sent around campus. Not only did she never give consent for every person she knew at JMU to see her topless, but she also was never even made aware that she was being taped. I remember being asked by a few of my friends (after the exact same trip) not to post some potentially embarrassing pictures to Facebook/the rest of the world, and those weren't even close to being sexually explicit. Can you imagine how violated you would feel if any stupider mistakes made during spring break were recorded and distributed without you even knowing it was happening? Yes, there are a lot of gray lines when it comes to drunk college decisions. And at the same time, yes, it is sad how often guys take advantage of drunk girls and step right over those gray lines without any remorse or public scrutiny. But with all the ""other sides"" aside, she was forced to deal with, in the words of Wikipedia, ""bullying or coercion of a sexual nature,"" and I don't care who the hell is at fault for her decision to show her tits to her guy friends at spring break (a decision shared by a large number, if not a majority, of Panama City spring breakers, not that that makes it justifiable, just putting it into perspective), the decision that the guys made to sexually harass her is in no way acceptable, and they should have to answer for their actions accordingly.",2014-06-25 20:16:28,8

comment,Other side of the sexual assault debate,"See here's the issue for me. How much alcohol does one need to drink before she is unable to give consent? One drink? Two drinks? Five?

I've had sex while I was very drunk/blacked out plenty of times while at school. Should I bring sexual assault or rape charges against those people because I was unable to consent at the time? Before you engage in anything sexual, do you explicitly ask permission for everything? * Me- ""Okay x, may I kiss you?"" * X- ""Yes you may"" We begin kissing * Me- ""X, may I touch your breasts?"" * X- ""Yes, and may I unbutton your pants?"" * Me- ""Yes you may, do I have permission to suck on your breasts?"" * X- ""Yes, you may. Do I have permission to grope your genitals?"" Etc. Shit, they may as well take the time to pull out a contract, grab some lawyers, and begin listing out what is and isn't consented to.

EDIT: I feel I may have misinterpreted you. I felt you were implying they turned it off because she expressed that she wasn't okay with it, so that they could continue.

comment,Other side of the sexual assault debate,"The incident happened in Florida, thus Florida law presides over it, not Virginia law. And, no, assault and battery are not practically synonyms. Legally speaking, assault is the threat of violence, but physical contact is not an element (at least in Virginia law). Battery, on the other hand, is the use of force and requires physical, undesired contact. The argument is not beyond whether this was sexual assault or not. If it was not sexual assault, then no punishment should have been administered. Whether or not it is sexual assault (or in this case, misdemeanor battery) is, in fact, a very relevant and central argument in this case. If, and only if, one determines it constitutes battery, then the question of appropriate punishment becomes relevant. EDIT: And yes, the ""include, but not limited to"" phrase is important. It does cover the crime of battery off-campus, apparently extending to Florida in this case. However, in my experiences with the JMU Judicial system, normally a crime has to have been committed and a criminal trial must have been conducted prior to JMU's action or inaction.

comment,Other side of the sexual assault debate,"Alright, fine. Seems that Florida only deems an act as ""sexual harassment"" when it occurs in the work place. So you're right, in the case of Florida laws, this situation fits the definition of Video Voyeurism. And according to the 2013 Florida Statutes 810.145, ""A person who is 19 years of age or older and who violates this section commits a FELONY of the third degree, punishable as provided in s. 775.082, s. 775.083, or s. 775.084."" And in Florida, the penalty for a third degree felony is max 5 years and $5000 fine. With that in mind, let's go back to JMU's Handbook. ""James Madison University reserves the right to hold students accountable for certain types of off-campus behavior. Disciplinary action will result if a student’s behavior compromises the educational atmosphere or mission of the institution."" So while the crime (Video Voyeurism) was committed in Florida, it became a university issue once it began to compromise the educational atmosphere (so much so that she is no longer a student there). And of course, there is no Video Voyeurism section in the student handbook, just as there is no definitive punishment statement for crimes that occur off-campus. That is what judicial affairs is for--to determine the appropriate punishments for JMU students. But when a crime is committed off-campus that would be defined by that state as a third-degree felony, and it is then treated by the school as nothing more than an embarrassingly minor infraction, then it is completely understandable that the victim would decide to take a stand and expose it to the public. Thanks to the vagueness of current sexual harassment/assualt/whatever you want to call it laws, these men may never see any types of harsher punishment, especially since two of them have already graduated and she no longer attends the school. But the exposure is still important, as it could potentially help future victims by setting a precedent for these types of crimes, and change the dangerous mindset of our current culture that these men's actions were a ""natural response."" Regardless of whether or not their actions were against the law (they were), victims of harassment, sexual or otherwise, should be able to feel protected and backed by their university, their workplace, their country.",2014-06-27 13:29:14,4

The argument is that she was SO drunk that she was not able to give consent. Also, she did not actually do anything. It was the men who touched her while she was unable to consent due to being too drunk. The men are being charged because they acted upon her. As a society we do not excuse people from their actions when those actions hurt people just because they were drunk. A drunk robber is still charged with robbery, a drunk person who rapes another person is still charged with rape. If the genders were reversed and a bunch of women (drunk or not) were to touch a clearly too drunk to consent man on his buttocks and genitals, the women would be charged, because they touched a person sexually when that person was not able to consent.",2014-06-25 09:50:56,2

The whole thing is national news because of the response by JMU to allow them to graduate. This entire post is basically trying to argue that it wasn't sexual battery/assault, but as you can see from my post and from the charges laid against the defendents, under virginia law this is sexual battery. I applied the **relevant state's law** because the action occurred **in that state**. Virginia law is completely irrelevant. If they had filmed themselves smoking weed in Colorado, would you be okay with JMU bringing action against them for violation of the drug/alcohol policy, under the premise that it's a crime in Virginia? The only relevant law in both cases is the law where the action occurred. And what ""charges"" were levied against the ""defendants""? As far as I'm aware, there have been **no criminal charges** pursued against them at all. The reason this is national news is because of a gripping headline, emotionally charged response, and lack of further investigation by people willing to accept one side's description of the events at face value.",2014-06-23 17:41:53,4
comment,Other side of the sexual assault debate,"Good find on the felony bit. Whether or not they'd be found guilty in a court of law under that statute is debatable though, and I've outlined their various defenses in another post in this thread. Regardless, I don't think JMU should make that determination. I think that JMU should wait until a criminal trial is conducted. If they were found not guilty of a criminal charge, I would not feel comfortable with JMU punishing them at all. If they were found guilty, then by all means JMU should punish them according to the guidelines set forth in the handbook, which in this case is a maximum of suspension. The guidelines should be amended, and that much I think is clear. And to say the boys escaped without seeing any type of harsher punishment is short-sighted I'd say. One of them already had a job offer rescinded because of that. Two of them have their names purchased as website domains linking to the Huffington Post article. They've received incredible amounts of media coverage that includes their names. They will not be able to land a decent job for a long, long time. Is that not punishment? As for this crime compromising the educational atmosphere so much that she no longer was able to continue her studies there, are you sure that she dropped out as a result of emotional strain from this? What were her grades before the incident? Could they have dropped from taking more classes, or taking harder classes, or from medical complications, or from excessive partying? If her educational opportunities and safety were so compromised, why did she continue to voluntarily spend every weekend with the Sigma Chi boys at Sigma Chi parties?

comment,Other side of the sexual assault debate,"I am fairly certain possession of the video is not a crime. The videotaping/dissemination would be the most legally questionable act: 2) Fla. Stat. Ann. § 810.145 – Video voyeurism (1) As used in this section, the term: (a) “Broadcast” means electronically transmitting a visual image with the intent that it be viewed by another person. (b) “Imaging device” means any mechanical, digital, or electronic viewing device; still camera; camcorder; motion picture camera; or any other instrument, equipment, or format capable of recording, storing, or transmitting visual images of another person. (c) **“Place and time when a person has a reasonable expectation of privacy”** means a place and time when a **reasonable person** would believe that he or she **could fully disrobe in privacy, without being concerned that the person’s undressing was being viewed, recorded or broadcasted by another** including, but not limited to, the **interior of a bathroom**, changing room, fitting room, dressing room, or tanning booth. (d) “Privately exposing the body” means exposing a **sexual organ**. (2) A person commits the offense of **video voyeurism** if that person: (a) For his or her own amusement, entertainment, sexual arousal, gratification, or profit, or for the purpose of degrading or abusing another person, intentionally uses or installs an imaging device to **secretly** view, broadcast, or record a person, **without that person’s knowledge and consent**, who is dressing, undressing, or **privately exposing the body**, at a place and time when that person has a **reasonable expectation of privacy**; (3) A person commits the offense of **video voyeurism dissemination** if that person, knowing or having reason to believe that an image was created in a manner described in this section, intentionally disseminates, distributes, or transfers the image to another person **for the purpose of amusement, entertainment, sexual arousal, gratification, or profit, or for the purpose of degrading or abusing another person.**",2014-06-25 13:33:45,1
comment,Other side of the sexual assault debate,"Reading into that, here's where I believe the boys would have defense: Definitions: 2c) Reasonable expectation of privacy- A reasonable person would expect privacy in their bathroom, sure. However, she brought the men into the bathroom. Even if that could not be proven, she was aware the men were in the room. She interacted with them, disrobed herself, and discussed the details of her breasts with the men. Would a reasonable person believe that she was not being recorded during that? Most likely. Then comes the issue of consent once again. She was intoxicated. Can an intoxicated person consent to expose themselves willingly? I would think so, but I admit I do not know case law history in FL related to this issue. 2d) Sexual organ- I don't think breasts would qualify. Okay so that covers definitions. Let's look at the statute itself: 2a) intentional use- yes. videographer intentionally videotaped. Was it secret? He had it out in the open. Was she aware of it at the time? Could she prove she was not aware of it at the time? Not remembering it =/= not being aware. That'd be a tough thing to prove in court, especially considering she interacted with the videographer in the video. Additionally, it requires the lack of knowledge **and** lack of consent. Consent is muddy and knowledge is muddy also. Could honestly go either way. Regardless, it's only relevant if it happens at a time when the person is ""undressing... at a time when that person has a reasonable expectation of privacy."" Once again, if she voluntarily strips for them, would she have a reasonable expectation that they would not record her? My best guess is that this statute was enacted to cover issues of voyeurism where people would install cameras inside bathrooms to videotape women changing or using the restroom without their knowledge and consent, hence the wording. I doubt it was crafted with this purpose, but nevertheless could be interpreted as such. On distribution, it would be a crime if the prior elements were satisfied to qualify as video voyeurism (which, as I said, is gray at best). **And** the distribution must be for the purpose of ""amusement, entertainment, sexual arousal, gratification, or profit, or for the purpose of degrading or abusing another person."" Their initial distribution would certainly qualify as one of those conditions, whether sexual arousal, entertainment, amusement, etc. However, someone leaking the video to shine light on the true incidents of the night, in order to contest the one-sided reports, along with an explicitly stated reasoning at the time of distribution that accompanies the video **may not qualify under those conditions**. **TL;DR- Possession is not illegal. Taping it was questionably legal. Dissemination depends on legality of taping, and if guilty of video voyeurism originally, initial dissemination illegal. Subsequent future dissemination for a more legitimate purpose could be potentially illegal, but likely would have more of a defense than the initial taping/dissemination would.**",2014-06-25 13:49:29,1

comment,Other side of the sexual assault debate,"I'm just curious, and just want to open up a conversation about this topic, so this by no means is an attack on you. Where do you draw the line on intoxicated consent? If I'm drunk, and I'm in that room, can I consent to being kissed? If I cannot, then her kissing me is battery. If I'm drunk, and I'm in that room, can I consent to being touched, **in any way at all**? If I cannot, then her touching my hand, without my consent, **even if I voice consent at the time**, is battery. If I'm drunk, and I'm in that room, can I consent **only to being touched in certain areas**? If I can, what specific body parts are those? Genitals? Buttocks? Legs? Lower stomach? Breasts? Where do you draw the line? And if I can't, then it's battery. If I'm drunk, and I'm in that room, and I find visible breasts and visible genitalia offensive, can I consent to seeing them? If not, she's guilty of indecent exposure. See how this gets complicated? They, too, were drunk. I know this isn't the case, but follow me here. Had she had sex with one of the men, is it rape? Who is charged? Her? Him? I recall a case in Virginia I believe, where two underage (<18, maybe <16) kids had sex consensually. The parents of the girl found out and pressed charges against the boy for rape, since a minor cannot consent to sex. The boy countersued for rape against the girl, since he could not consent to sex either. The case was eventually dropped on both parts. So lets extrapolate this to intoxicated sex (or, in this case, touching). If both parties agree to sex or touching at the time, and both parties engage in it, who gets charged after the fact? Both parties? One party? The male? It's such a complicated legal matter, and one that, in my opinion, **needs to be decided by a court of law, not a university's judicial board**.",2014-06-25 10:24:15,3

post,Another student that wants to drop out,"Another student that wants to drop out **LONG POST** College is so draining emotionally, physically, and mentally, man. I honestly contemplate dropping out every semester but this semester the urge is extra strong. I have 0 motivation to keep going but I’m already 3 years “behind” all my peers and am first gen, so I kinda feel like theres no room for me to take anymore time away from getting my bachelors. I’m a double major in two bioscience fields and although the material I’m learning is *really* fascinating to me, I perform poorly on exams and always average out a B every semester. How are my cohorts so good at these biology classes to where they get As? Additionally, I just don’t know what I’ll do with just a biology bachelors degree b/c to get any *real* work + good pay in the field (microbiology), I’m gonna have to go on to get my Masters and maybe my PhD but I literally do not have the energy for that. Zero motivation. All I feel is pressure man my mental health is not okay. Current and former students, how are you feeling? Fellow STEM students, can you relate? Anyone who dropped out, how has your life changed and are you happy with your decision? Anyone share your story. I just need motivation men, we’re all in this together. P.s. **GO VOTE**",2020-10-01 18:55:44,47
comment,Another student that wants to drop out,"It took me 8 years to graduate undergrad and I make more than most of my friends who graduated on time now. Yes, that included breaks. Don’t worry about being behind. Also don’t worry about finding work in your “Major”, you and most people will never even have a job that’s relevant to it.

comment,Another student that wants to drop out,"Took me 6 years to graduate. I love school but have always struggled. Turns out I have ADHD and didn't get diagnosed until after I finished my degree. Shit could have been so much easier if I had realized what was going on, that it wasn't just personal failing. ADHD is very treatable, and I'm frustrated that I waited so long to seek treatment. It's worth talking to a therapist or doctor about your struggles, because there could be stuff going (ADHD, depression, learning disorder, etc.) on that is making school 10x harder for you than it is for everyone else.",2020-10-01 19:58:58,12
comment,Another student that wants to drop out,Absolutely zero fucks are given by employers for your grades. They care that you are passionate about the material and that you finished. So keep going! Long term gain for short term pain. I believe in you. Redirect your angst into the subjects that fascinate you. Go read more chapters not in the syllabus. Watch YouTube videos of science presenters in your field. Call your family they’ll appreciate it. :) good luck!,2020-10-01 21:31:24,8
comment,Another student that wants to drop out,"About your grades, ""B"" is a solid grade. There is nothing wrong with having a ""B"" average. The guys from *Car Talk* once said that [a grade of ""B"" is absolutely wonderful](https://clyp.it/ivtuzwdv). You might want to take the advice that they give out here to heart. Also, don't forget that ultimately, a bachelor's degree is a checkbox. And most people end up in jobs after college that don't have much to do with their major. So try not to stress it, graduate with a ""B"" average, and go forth and make us all proud. I'm giving you permission.",2020-10-01 22:29:53,8

comment,Another student that wants to drop out,"Hey I hope you’re doing okay. I have a lot of mental health issues and I’m about two years behind my friends. I had a really hard time my freshman year, I’ve dropped out twice. It’s so hard to keep going but it’s worth it I promise. Even though my drop out plan worked (I started a business) I still miss college and I want to do something more with my life. So I’m going back to major in psych. Currently taking one online class that I’m failing. Turns out I have bipolar 1 and adhd. Oh and ptsd! So yes as others have mentioned you may want to talk to someone to see if there’s another reason why you might be struggling so much. Hang in there, don’t drop out and best of luck to you.",2020-10-01 22:10:41,5
comment,Another student that wants to drop out,"My grades did not matter for this field. I was a Biochem/Biosciences major and I was burnt out. I had the same realization about my future, but also realized that I wasn't ready to go to graduate school, academically, mentally, and personally. I've had three positions since I've graduated and my grades did not matter for any of them. They are all in the field and they have allowed me to build a supportive life (yes I make real money with my bachelor's of science) for myself, gain experience to offset my undergrad, prepare me for grad school, but most importantly make me confident in my abilities and help me decide what I want to work on and what environment I want to work in for the main portion of my life. Whatever you think is gonna be best for you will be best for you and you can't worry about comparing yourself to others. If you think some time off to work, and then finish your bachelor's when you feel like you can up your grades is good for you sure. You could also power through and finish as fast as possible. There's also part-time if you feel too overwhelmed. I'm not sure about your entire situation, but I think you will never be upset with making your mental health the deciding factor. After college I may have felt a little lost and unsure of myself and what I was doing and where I was going, but 6 years post graduation I'm proud of my journey and I can look back an see I did the best I could while still keeping my head above water and other decisions probably would have damaged my mental health substantially. It sucks cause you can't always see the benefits of your decisions often until a lot of time has passed, but as long as you accept your decisions and have confidence in the fact that you know what is best for you, you will be okay.",2020-10-02 00:45:15,2
comment,Another student that wants to drop out,"It took me five years and some terrible grades to graduate. If I had dropped out I would not have the career I have now or the lifestyle that I have. Not saying I’m making boatloads of money, but putting my head down and finishing what I needed to allowed me to get a job I enjoy that pays well. Many people to great things and make plenty of money NOT going to college, but if you’re interested in STEM fields and bioscience, you most definitely will need a degree. Take your time, take care of yourself, and get that stupid expensive piece of paper.",2020-10-05 16:48:52,1
comment,Another student that wants to drop out,"Don't drop out!!! Getting Bs in challenging classes is excellent. Don't let anyone make you feel bad about that. Also, after college no one ever looked at my grades until I applied for grad school. I left undergrad for a year and ended up living in my car without health insurance. For me, the difference between the college degree and not having it was being able to get a salaried job (which meant being able to rent a place, because I had a paper saying I'd get paid regularly) and having benefits (health insurance)! I didn't make so much more, but the ability to get those things made a big difference in my quality of life. Also, get mental health treatment ASAP. It might not show benefits immediately, but it'll be worth it in the long run. One more thing: The CSM interim dean (I assume you're a CSM student) is a 1st gen college grad. I'm sure there are many others around - it's a really hard thing. Ask for help if you need it. If you can't think of anyone to ask, PM me.",2020-10-06 08:55:05,1

comment,Another student that wants to drop out,"TBH it is a pain in the ass to get dx'd as an adult. For me, it was about a 7 month process overall. I went to my general doctor, told her I think I have ADHD and she referred me to a psychologist who had me do a ton of tests. About 5-6 hours of testing overall. Cognitive tests that looked at ADHD, learning disorders, autism, and similar stuff, as well as tests for mood disorders/other mental illness. The psychologist then dx'd me with ADHD, depression, and anxiety, and some other stuff. Some people can get diagnosed by their GP but I think most doctors want you to get tested by a psychologist to be certain since ADHD meds are easily addicting/abused by people who don't have ADHD. Now I'm dealing with trying to get on medication and insurance is being weird about it. It's an uphill battle, for sure.",2020-10-02 00:00:54,4
comment,Another student that wants to drop out,Just talk to a psychiatrist I just got diagnosed bipolar 1 and adhd they are comorbid a lot of the times,2020-10-01 22:07:17,3
comment,Another student that wants to drop out,"If you’ve already been diagnosed with bipolar, it’s fairly easy to get diagnosed with adhd because they run hand in hand. You can talk to a PCP, who will either test you or refer you to a psychiatrist, or you can contact the psychiatrist who originally diagnosed you. I’m bipolar 1 with adhd. All they did was ask me a list of yes or no questions about my attention span, childhood and family history, and I scored highly enough to be considered adhd. It took maybe 30 minutes. I was very open and specific about my symptoms, so that eased the process. Also important to note: If they prescribe you medication, you will probably have to sign papers basically saying that you won’t sell or share anything and you understand the consequences if you do, and agree to random drug testing. You also have to visit a lot more frequently to get your prescription refilled because they’re controlled substances.",2020-10-02 01:42:45,3

He bring her along sometimes when he preaches at ecu. She isnt aloud to speak in public or do anything really. The thing about him is you can't take him seriously. If you bring up a good argument to what he says, he's going to not answer you and ignore you. At ecu, everyone loved hearing brother ross was there. We would all go out and listen to all the freshman try to argue with him to no avail. Only freshman would argue with him because like i said everyone else knew better.

post,JMUPark,"JMUPark Hello everyone, I graduated 4 years ago. when I was in undergrad I started a little project called JMUPark. It tried to guess how many parking spaces at a certain parking deck there was at any given time. Back then, it kind of sucked. I didn't really train the model correctly but recently I had a resurgence of motivation to get it to work, and I re-trained it on more data and it is actually pretty good. I'm sharing it because when I was in undergrad it would have been nice to try to get some semblance of how the parking situation would look like the next day or to maybe help new commuters out at JMU. Thank you for reading [https://www.jmupark.com](https://www.jmupark.com)",2024-09-23 21:34:19,43
comment,JMUPark,"This is really cool! Thank you for sharing! It would be cool to compare your findings to the class schedules across campus and see how the spikes compare and maybe you could even calculate the average walk time to each lot based off of the delay in spikes from classes letting out. Sorry it’s late and I’m rambling. I am curious how you got this data though, did you set up a program to steal the data from JMU parking at a set interval all day? Do you store that data or does JMU parking store that data? I feel like I could do some cool engineering projects by analyzing this data. Thanks again for posting this!",2024-09-23 22:42:09,6

Any additional ideas I do love to hear. I just need some way to get the data so I can work with it. I could definitely do some other cool stuff like calculate delays in spikes, integrate class times within the data(train the model to also take into account class times like 8:00 AMs vs 9:05AMs or something)",2024-09-23 23:03:35,6

post,Kinda a long update so sorry in advance,"Kinda a long update so sorry in advance In light of the Board of Visitors’ Meeting today, I wanted to share some things. It’s been a while since I’ve been active on this account, so here’s an update on everything: 1. Mental health: This is a really sensitive topic so I’m going to preface by increasing funding via donors and the state. JMU has been trying to hire more positions in the counseling center however, there’s a problem with colleges that are in rural locations-- they have a hard time recruiting new employees. Demand is higher for a workplace in an urbanized setting vs. a rural one. In the past few years, funding has increased by $1.2M and that number will continue to grow. SGA has put out a Bill of Opinion for mental health advocacy; this passed in the Senate on Tuesday. This piece of literature has over 4,200+ signatures (roughly 20% of the student population) and is expected to gain more signatures. Admin is completely on-board with this request; we’ve been working tirelessly with Senior Leadership, the Counseling Center staff, legislators, etc. to get them to put some more money in the pot! The budgeting process for colleges is a bit odd but we should see a significant increase in funding for the next fiscal/academic year (I forgot which one because those budgeting timeframes are so confusing to keep up with). Student Representative to the Board of Visitors (and amazing best friend), Xavier Williams, and I will be in Richmond in a few days at the Virginia General Assembly to advocate for financial aid-based scholarships and other legislation (college affordability, food security, etc. are all contributing factors for student mental health and well-being). My goal is to spark conversations about increasing funding for mental health support on college campuses. We’ve been in talk with student leaders at UVA and VT and they’re all on board to advocate for this as the struggle for mental health support is a college epidemic. Unfortunately, it’s too late in the General Assembly to put in a request so the best we can do is get delegates to understand the weight of this crisis and then put in legislation for the next cycle. I’m also the co-chair for the Student Advisory Council to the State Council of Higher Education for Virginia which means that I represent all public colleges across Virginia. In essence-- they can’t play with me. Systemic mental health issues can’t be solved solely with funding-- the counseling center is a large aspect but it’s not a topical solution for a complex feedback system. We truly need to integrate mental health support into every aspect of this university-- I’m talking Academic Affairs, student organizations, Residence Life, etc. This is also a community issue; we need to support one another and that honestly starts with you (as in you, the one who’s reading this). Offer to punch for someone or compliment someone in line at Starbucks-- idk just do something like that! It’s so easy to be nice but some people act like it’s so hard. I’ve seen a lot of posts asking about why JMU hasn’t “recognized what happened.” Firstly, they do, it’s just handled in a private manner that’s direct with family. They don’t publicize these instances out of respect for the individual and the wishes of their families/loved ones. 2. Sustainability: The President of the Environmental Management Club and I have formed a working group of 17 students to conduct research on environmental policy; this ranged from ISAT to SMAD to ECON majors. We met with President Alger and some other important figureheads by showing them that JMU can commit to carbon neutrality (ideally we wanted to see carbon net-zero but we knew that *literally* stood no chance). We gave a 40-minute presentation by offering different methods, ways to finance the plan, a cost-benefit analysis, etc. We left them with a 13-page leave-behind with all of the feedback we collected from the survey that we went out earlier the past few months. Moving forward, we’re now working with CJ Hartman, the director for the ISNW to figure out ways we can cut JMU’s greenhouse gas emissions. We’re trying to be strategic in how we do this so we’re looking at a plan to significantly reduce emissions in the next few years and then possibly move forward with a carbon neutrality plan. I think the idea of carbon neutrality is a little too daunting/lib for some people in leadership and this seems like the only way to pave a path to progress so we’ll take it to get out foot in the door. 3. Safety: I met with the JMU Chief of Police last week and we discussed communication in these emergency situations which unfortunately continue to occur. To preface, my problem is that students go unaware of the safety issues because they’re not relayed to them via the text system in place. The JMU Chief told me that he’s planning to use Livesafe for non-threatening emergency updates HOWEVER, there’s an issue with this because the entire freshman class doesn’t even have this app and ALSO a bunch of current students and faculty, have deleted this app. Now I’m going to work to try to get people to download this app again so if you don’t have it, please down Livesafe lol. Also to add, I don’t think anyone understands the full extent to how frustrated I was with the communication aspect. I was sitting outside of my foreign policy class calling the JMUPD, Tim Miller, Xaiver, the Police Department at BC, and even the spokeswoman of JMU to get something out. Please download LiveSafe. Like actually. Please. Miscellaneous things: This sounds insane but please respect my privacy. I’ve received several messages (and gifts?) from people who I don’t know regarding my apartment. I love talking to people but this is the one thing that actually freaks out me and my roommates. If you want to approach me about my apartment/where I live, please don’t do it anonymously; it freaks me out. If you want to grab coffee, chat, or just complain-- I’m always open! I prefer a dm over Instagram (@jessani4jmu) and we can find a chunk of time to meet. I also love talking to you guys; I spend most of my time at ecl trying to understand ECON300/ECON372 so if you see me there or in line getting a Trenta cold brew with a double shot, just say hi. Anyways, please take care of yourselves! There’s so much more to add to this but I wanted to focus on 3 big things I’ve been working on recently.",2022-02-17 17:36:31,43

post,Dealing with post-college depression,"Dealing with post-college depression First of all, congratulations to all the Dukes on yet another great FDOC! I’m excited for all of y’all. Maybe this is whining but whatever. I really miss college. I graduated this past spring and I’m really proud of spending the past four years at such an awesome college. However, adjusting to being back home kinda sucks, not going to lie. My life feels more “hollow” at home than when I was at JMU. Is anybody else experiencing this? Seeing all these snap stories of frog week and of seeing old friends is hitting different. If any other old heads out there has advice, I’d seriously appreciate it.

comment,Dealing with post-college depression,"Thank you so much for posting this. Exactly how I feel. This past week in particular has been hard for me since it's been MRD band camp week... I really miss campus and the sunsets and ehall brunch. And band obviously. I deactivated my Facebook recently because it just got me super depressed. Glad I am not alone. Again, thanks for sharing because I am 100% with you. Waiting to go to some football games or take a weekend trip to campus at some point. As for trying to deal with all the sad feels, We got robbed as seniors. Stuck inside all the time. It's ok to feel sad since we definitely didn't get the ""normal"" senior year experience. (Ex: no senior year band camp, POC, senior night, etc) I think we are grieving for what we lost or what could have been. Journaling helps. Did you check social media recently? That always brings me a rush of excitement and then into a pit of sadness like... 5 minutes later. Remember that no one can take your JMU experience away from you. Try to remember some of the not-so-fun aspects (hard classes, 8ams, no AC, etc). ""Moving on"" takes time. I highly doubt we are the only two people who graduated this spring who have no idea wtf to do next.",2021-08-26 15:30:08,11

I miss my friends without a doubt. A lot of them are getting married so catching up with them every now and then has been nice but it's not the same. Having a weekday 9-5 job kinda takes away from having the ability to build new friendships where I'm at and I'm not the best at going around and making friends out of strangers. So I totally understand for sure. I'm not a very emotional person so it doesn't bother me a whole ton not having that sense of community anymore, but it's kinda sad when I reminisce about it for sure.",2021-08-26 15:57:52,6
comment,Dealing with post-college depression,"The good news is that when polled, most 50-year-olds say that they are the happiest they've ever been, thanks to a combination of financial security, experience leading to better life decisions, a stable network of family and friends, and so on. So, the odds are that after a post-college slump, you will start to slowly recognize the merits of full-on adulthood and embrace them, and eventually they'll eclipse the parts of college life that you view through rose-tinted glasses. I'm hoping I'll get there eventually too, either as a result of my life actually getting better, or the memories of college fading, or a little of both. Billy Joel had some interesting things to say about aging, particularly in his song ""Vienna."" [Here is a link](https://youtu.be/sWRiiH2MJ2U) to some thoughts he imparts on aging when talking about writing that song.

post,JMU shouldn’t put students in this situation,"JMU shouldn’t put students in this situation I’m kind of angry with jmu because they shouldn’t have students unnecessarily stressed about whether to withdraw from the university or risking their health. The simple solution is to move classes online and it feels like they’re doing everything in their power to avoid that. There are just too many factors at play here to say that students will be safe on campus, especially with the surrounding community being a corona hotspot there is bound to be an outbreak on campus. All it takes is one student who thinks they are invincible. I think I’m going to withdraw. I came into jmu with 35 dual enrollment credits so I wouldn’t be behind when I decide to enroll again. And I still plan on taking my remaining gen eds at a community college during my semester away. It just sucks to even be put in this predicament.",2020-08-06 22:00:47,43

comment,JMU shouldn’t put students in this situation,"The school had all summer to think of strategies to implement online learning.

Those investments won't see any return because they need people on campus in order to generate revenue, which is why they are dragging their feet with going online. They're about to lose a ton of revenue and all that construction will be for nothing. Students shouldn't have to bear the brunt of the admins mistakes.",2020-08-07 12:25:34,2
post,PSA: student employees who are out of work are eligible for pandemic unemployment assistance,"PSA: student employees who are out of work are eligible for pandemic unemployment assistance The recently passes CARES act massively expands the range of people who are eligible to receive unemployment assistance. I was a student employee who was making $7.25 an hour and working about 5 hours a week until the college shut down, and all the jobs I applied to post-graduation have hiring freezes. My income was too low to qualify for regular unemployment but I decided ""screw it"" and applied for pandemic unemployment assistance. I'm now making $150/week unemployment + $600 week until 7/25. This is literally life changing for me, as I ran out of savings and was quickly going into credit card debt to be able to afford to live. I strongly encourage everyone else to apply!

comment,PSA: student employees who are out of work are eligible for pandemic unemployment assistance,"I can't guarantee anything, of course, but you *should* be. I only made about $75 biweekly (working for student activities and involvement) and I managed to qualify, so I think pretty much everyone will. The one stipulation is that you have to apply to at least 2 jobs a week to continue to receive benefits, and you must take a job if it is offered to you (and pays enough to cover your needs).

Would have loved to see JMU send an email out to students letting them know about the unemployment (base + additional $600) as it has been beyond helpful to me. Many of my friends who I mention it to had no idea that it was even a thing.

post,Important tip for all the freshmen coming into JMU - Do yourself a favor and avoid getting sucked in to a pyramid scheme or deceptive company.,"Important tip for all the freshmen coming into JMU - Do yourself a favor and avoid getting sucked in to a pyramid scheme or deceptive company. You guys are new to the whole college experience. It's going to be fun starting out but I want to inform people on the ridiculously popular and annoying scams/deceptive companies that you'll probably get exposed to: 1. Anything to do with Vector Marketing or Cutco should be avoided like the plague. These guys are the most popular so I'm giving them their own little plaque of (dirty) success. As the infamous Donald J. Trump would say, they're more crooked than Crooked Hillary. Their business model is to have you try and sell knives door-to-door and through harassment of your friends and family. They use a lot of shady advertising, are pushy on interviews, and like to keep the details of what the job actually is hidden. You'll notice how you never see their name on their advertisements. [Not to mention they are a member of the Direct Selling Association, an organization priding itself in trying to protect multi-level marketing schemes.](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Direct_Selling_Association) Just Google them to see MUCH more on why you should avoid. 2. Watch for deceptive advertising on campus. I went to community college for 2 years so it's not as rampant here, but watch out for the following: Ads for $15 an hour written on boards, posted on flyers in dorms/halls/etc., being handed out by people, and so on. Guaranteed they won't have the name of the actual company listed on the ad, just some sketch website. Do your class a favor and erase that shit or tear it down. Dorms included, chances are they have absolutely no authority to put up the ads. 3. Same goes for Facebook and social media. Some kid will try and push a great ""opportunity"", position that pays very well, etc. on the JMU Class of 2020 page. The name of the company will be nowhere to be found. Although your job of sniffing out the bullshit is easier because they usually plaster their involvement with Vector on their profile. And in general just remember if that shit's sounding too good to be true, it probably is. Especially if the company can't be tasked to put their name on the ad. These guys are legal but they're straight nasty. If you want to sell stuff for money, run through thrift stores or something on your own. **Big edit:** Shout outs to the MVP's in the comments bringing up fraudulent emails. When JMU hounds you 24/7 on the dangers phishing schemes and other email tomfoolery they aren't bullshitting. Usually the scams are pretty obvious and poorly done, but it's fairly common to get malicious emails trying to screw you over. Don't even try responding to some nonsense ""job"" opportunity sent via email promising $400 a month. The campus directory lists emails for all students, faculty, etc. so there really isn't anything you can do to stop the flow of them if someone decides to log all the emails. Just don't fuck with anything even remotely smelling fishy.",2016-06-22 14:13:32,43
comment,Important tip for all the freshmen coming into JMU - Do yourself a favor and avoid getting sucked in to a pyramid scheme or deceptive company.,"I'll add to this: The brother (or some relative similar, I can't exactly remember) of Zane Showker (the family for which the College of Business is named after) was running a pyramid scheme and attempting to bring college aged kids into the mix. I was invited by a friend to a business / 'networking' meeting, and being a junior at the time, was all about networking and finding a future job, etc. This friend was hyping up how I would make money on the side, my own schedule, meet new people, and was selling up this Showker brother. I end up going to this meeting held at the Harrisonburg Hampton Inn (over by east campus and the Walmart) hoping to make some new connections. There was an initial meeting for some networking, so all is good right? Next thing I know we are directed to the conference room where we sat in for several hours listening to assorted people trying to sell us into these some herblife /amway products and how easy it was to expand your network and bring it more friends and you get all the kickbacks. Total BS. I was so pissed I got suckered into this. And to add to my annoyance, the showker brother was hailed as some sort of God, with last name recognition and the leader of this group. It was seriously out of some cult movie and everyone was buying into this. Please avoid these things. Thanks op for bringing it up.",2016-06-22 16:31:06,8

Some are these really fucking sketchy like ""Work from home for $18/hr, email me for details"".

comment,JMU Silent BLM Protest on campus this Friday,"The difference between blacks killing blacks and cops killing blacks is that cops are in an authoritative position. There is a social contract that we all have – that if you steal or if I steal, then the person with the authority power steps in to fix the solution. But the person who fixes the solution is killing them \[blacks\]. So the social contract is broken. And if the social contract is broken, then why the f\*ck would blacks care if they steal or break the law. The contract was broken when cops kill blacks in the streets and didn’t give a f\*ck. &#x200B; The black community has played the American game for 400 years. Blacks have built america’s wealth and have gotten so little recognition. The contract was broken in 1921 when a wealthy black community in Tulsa was bombed due to racial differences. When black communities built themselves up in Rosewood in 1923 and were massacred in the streets. We are lucky that what blacks are going for is ‘equality’ and not ‘revenge’.

comment,JMU Silent BLM Protest on campus this Friday,"Because “black people killed in gang fights” is not a systemic problem in the government. And because murder between regular people is highly illegal and people get arrested for it, but when a police officer murders a black man or woman they try to cover it up and defend the officer. Your argument is a really common one and it basically boils down to “black people shouldn’t be mad about police killing them because they also kill each other.” Do you not see how that’s racist and wrong?",2020-06-10 02:07:17,18

comment,JMU Silent BLM Protest on campus this Friday,"I'm going to copy this word for word from a 2016 Vox story that debunks your argument. I really hope you read more. ""Black people aren't uniquely predisposed to commit crimes against each other; crime is generally just racially segregated, based on a number of factors, including that most people commit crimes against people they either know or live near. According to the FBI's 2014 Uniform Crime Reports, close to 90 percent of African-American homicides were committed by other African Americans, while the majority (82 percent) of white American homicide victims were killed by other white people. Another factor that contributes to crime is poverty. A 2014 special report by the Department of Justice found that black and white households that lived in poverty were much more likely to be victims of crime, and were victims of crimes at similar rates (51.3 per 1,000 compared with 56.4 per 1,000, respectively). Black people are more likely to live in poverty without the resources necessary to get out of it. Redlining practices targeting black communities have deprived entire neighborhoods of their economic viability for generations. A 2015 report by the Century Foundation found that more than one in four African Americans lived in concentrated poverty, in comparison to one in 13 white people. Meanwhile, white families have six times as much wealth as black families, and the poverty rate for black people (27.2 percent) is almost three times that of their white counterparts (9.6 percent). Additionally, unemployment is far higher for black people, and always has been — by at least 60 percent since data collection started in 1972. At the end of 2015, the black unemployment rate was 9.5 percent — only slightly less than the national peak (9.9 percent) in 2009. The white unemployment rate was 4.5 percent. And yet politicians and government officials have advocated for community policing programs to curb crime, despite a lack of evidence demonstrating that it effectively does so. In September 2015, Attorney General Loretta Lynch announced that the Department of Justice would provide $12 million for these programs. In fact, racist policing can exacerbate these issues. Some departments try to turn a profit by ticketing, which tends to exploit racially biased policing practices. The Department of Justice’s report on Ferguson, Missouri, showed high incarceration rates there, because residents often could not afford to pay the fines incurred from ticketing they disproportionately faced. And a panel of New York police officers recently admitted they often target the most vulnerable — poor people, people of color, and LGBTQ people — to meet quotas. Violence within black communities and the overpolicing of black people are linked. But if an honest conversation is going to be had about either topic, especially in light of the latest officer-involved fatal shootings of black people, it needs to based on the fact that ""black-on-black crime"" is not simply black people's making.""",2020-06-10 08:48:11,4
comment,JMU Silent BLM Protest on campus this Friday,"Again, you’re completely missing the point of my argument and straw manning me. Literally all I’m saying is that black on black crime is a much bigger problem for black people than police brutality. Everything you’ve said is a giant red herring, it has nothing to do with my argument. I’m just saying a lot of black people die from killing eachother, regardless of what the reasons are for those crime rates.",2020-06-10 12:24:44,-4
comment,JMU Silent BLM Protest on campus this Friday,"I don't think you have a strong grasp on logical fallacies. Know that if you use an infographic to get a definition of these, you probably need to investigate further. Let's break it down. Your assertion is that we should not be worried about police violence against black people (which empirical evidence shows happens to black people at a much higher rate than with white people) since you believe that black people already commit the majority of crimes against other black people. This is in spite of crime statistics that show white people, when adjusted for similarities in socioeconomic status, are also the largest victims of other white people in crimes. So, you negate the very real issue of police violence by bringing in an unrelated data set with the intention of muddying the waters. You cherry picked information to advance a political agenda when you could have supported your argument with valid sources and evidence. However, you chose to do none of that and instead levied an ad hominem attack at me when I presented you with evidence. So fuck you.",2020-06-10 13:57:09,2

Bill Gates also stated in an interview that he believes schools will reopen in the fall. 2. In some schools, teachers are reporting fewer than half of students attending their classes due to internet problems or lack of motivation. So online classes are gonna cause damage over a long period of time. 3. JMU is planning to hold the commencement ceremonies in August if it is safe enough. 4. The number of deaths that was predicted has been decreased to around 60,000 so we are in a better situation than we thought 5. Antibody tests are emerging and look promising 6.

The dorms will likely be open until Sat/Sun, and trust me your family doesn’t miss you that much to where they’d be mad that you stayed an extra night to live it up and go to the playoff game. Last Saturday was complicated with many having exams, but there needs to be a much much stronger student presence at Friday’s game. Student guest tickets are also $8 so invite your family, friends, plugs, study buddies, that hot girl that sits a few seats down from you in your GenEd class, your homies that go to Tech who want to watch some real football for a change — bring anyone and everyone.

I happen to live on Eastover Dr (hence the throwaway), and while I am not the person who requested the increased police presence, I am glad to see the general encouragement to SLOW DOWN! &#x200B; I get it. It's a convenient shortcut. As a person who chose to live on this road, I do not begrudge the traffic one bit. If I were in your shoes, I would do the exact same thing. &#x200B; But when you come hauling ass over the blind hill at 40+ mph, it's not only dangerous to you, it puts my kid at risk. It puts my 95yr old neighbor walking his blind and deaf dog at risk. It puts my neighbors' kids at risk. It puts my car parked on the street at risk. It puts YOU at risk for a head on collision when I am driving towards you over that blind hill. &#x200B; So please, continue to use Eastover as a shortcut. That's fine. But please do it at the posted speed limit. &#x200B; Love, Your neighbor and fellow Dukes fan",2018-12-05 12:52:20,41

Probably another one of the reasons they're dropping ""main campus"" is because that area isn't the ""main"" campus anymore. They moved all the student services to the Student Success Center instead of in Wilson and Taylor Hall (now called Madison Union I think), and D-Hall has been gone for a while and the construction is taking up a lot of that area.

post,Transferring from UVA to JMU,"Transferring from UVA to JMU Hey guys, So, I was accepted into JMU in 2021, but I waited an extra year just to be accepted into UVA in the fall of 2022. My goal was to major in CS; however, UVA told me that I transferred in with too many credits and I was forced to change my major to cognitive science with a concentration in computer science. They waited until November to tell me this, which caused my schedule to become terrible because I was now pursuing a major I had no idea about. Additionally, the CS department at UVA is terrible. There is a lack of resources for students, inaccurate study guides, and unprofessional conduct. For example, my professor misgraded my final project, even though I had worked very hard on it and exceeded expectations. However, my professor is giving me the run-around regarding fixing his mistake, and I’m tired of the unprofessionalism. Everything has boiled over, and I have decided to transfer out. Although UVA may be prestigious in certain areas, the CS department is not one of them. What is the process like for transferring to JMU? Also, is the CS department there competent?",2023-05-13 12:41:12,42

comment,Transferring from UVA to JMU,CS at JMU as of 2019 is WAY better than CS at UVA as of 2014 for undergrad.

comment,Transferring from UVA to JMU,"My son just graduated from JMU, with a major in CS, double minor in ethics (philosophy) and machine learning. He's planning to go to NoVa next year to VT satellite campus for his master's. I think he told me if you keep a certain GPA, you can easily xfer after your bachelor's (you are basically accepted automatically, don't quote me on this) The CS curriculum is grueling, but it is an environment where the professors are super super nice and help kids develop their soft skills (teaching, assisting professors in research internships, speaking at conferences about their research). My son has developed in so many ways, and he says the teachers, and fellow students are amazingly smart, the professors are kind and he developed really close relationships with the WHOLE JMU faculty in the CS department. As a mom, which I never expected, all 3 of my kids are JMU kids. In addition, I have a rising junior at the music school (excellent, so many performances for everyone) and a rising freshman who intends to study education). These all seem like a school within a school and my two dukes know everyone in their dept. CS is on East campus, music on West campus. They didn't see each other often on campus, but got together for concerts and lunch etc. Couldn't be more proud that my daughter chose JMU for next year.

comment,Transferring from UVA to JMU,"The CS department at JMU is phenomenal and underrated— way more than “competent”. All I heard about in high school four years ago was VT and UVA being the only CS programs, but that is really not the case. The professors really challenge their students here and are super helpful, grade fairly, etc (though like any CS program it is not easy). You will learn a lot from the program and what it offers. The department also does great with offering resources to students such as TA hours and CS student ambassadors, who can talk way more about the department (visit their website). I would highly recommend going to JMU for CS. All my friends and I already have jobs and everything too. Best of luck to you and hope this helps.",2023-05-14 10:27:22,2
comment,Transferring from UVA to JMU,"some context: I’m a current JMU student who’s jumped around majors some and settled on Geographic Science one of the like 7 majors along with CS in the college of integrated science and engineering (CISE). This year I have been enrolled in the CS entry courses and have applied to add the CS major, i hear back in a few days. It’s true that I wouldn’t say JMU as a whole is #1 in academic rigor in the state, but I can say that in comparison to other colleges in JMU, CISE is very serious about preparing students for after graduation. It’s separate from the college of math and science so focus on the applied sciences and problem solving and dominates the entire east campus. CISE is super involved beyond the classroom with career fairs, speakers, hosting national competitions, and tech firm meet and greets and things like that and there is also a lot of organizations that use the labs that are focused on integrated sciences. (By all this I mean that a lot of other colleges in JMU kinda felt very traditional to me and CISE felt very live and out of the box. I’d use an analogy of like a traditional 9 to 5 compared to like working at google and all their weird little out of the box things). To finish out talking about CISE I can say the department helped me get a job/internship at a fortune 500 tech company with a security clearance as a sophomore/junior with one of the less in demand majors (GS). More specifically about the CS major: the CS and engineering majors really have extraordinarily high quality resources and professors so they require students with interest complete a year worth of class work and apply because they have a limited number of seats. With this scarcity and competition there is a downside that the schedule of coursework is very rigid and does not have much wiggle room, but technically after the application year the major (not counting gen ed electives) can be completed in 2 years, so applying with credits under your belt would give you a leg up on selecting the best CS classes before more people. With your CS background I suggest you reach out and meet with Paige Normand (just google her name and jmu for contact) over zoom and maybe jmu admissions to find out logistics transferring into the CS program here. In my year of experience with the CS program and my experience jumping around majors and departments I can say that CS has some excellent professors and some really incredible student support. The classes are hard but there are TONS of resources to help you from the best teaching assistant tutor program I’ve seen at JMU to Piazza (an online forum) to just how helpful and willing to work with you the professors are you will always be able to put in the work to earn good grades. In JMU CS, you will also run into the math department a ton. For the classes you need there’s tutoring and resources provided by the school as well (more context I’ve completed a math minor here, which you will be like two classes away from completing if you are in CS here). Just about JMU in general I’m not going to go too in depth cause I already wrote like wayyy too much, but I love it here. I also got into UVA and changed my mind because they canceled in-person classes that year but I have never regretted my decision to come here. Sorry I wrote so much and it’s one big ole block of text i don’t use reddit all too often and I just wanted to make sure I could give as much info as I could. Def investigate and make an informed decision but remember that anywhere you go is only limited by you and what you make of it. Best of Luck!",2023-05-14 19:28:43,2

I know both Bridgewater College and JMU have requested additional support from the local community services boards, so hopefully some more beneficial work can be done and support can be provided to students.

We were basically told to lie about it or our security clearances could be revoked and we could possibly get kicked out the military just for saying “yes, I have some issues from seeing my friend with his legs blown off” or something of that manner.

post,"Haven't found your ""group"" at JMU","Haven't found your ""group"" at JMU Hey guys! As the end of this semester comes to an end, I can't help but feel a bit sad. I'm a Sophomore here and feel like I haven't found ""my people"" yet. I have friends, and am in like 4 clubs which I am pretty involved in. It just feels like I haven't found my group yet and wondered if I am alone in feeling this? It's just stressful to see everyone look so happy with their core group and stuff while I just feel like I haven't found that and maybe won't. Like I said, I have friends, and they are pretty great people. I know a lot of people from classes, clubs, etc. but I just feel like I don't have those deep connections.

comment,"Question: if JMU isn’t handling things well, which higher education institution is? Who has the model solutions? If you were a decision maker, how would you navigate these times?","(1) Test students several days upon return. I understand that there's the possibility they still catch the virus between then and arriving, but it would give JMU an idea of what they were dealing with in terms of cases and lessen the chance of a widespread outbreak. UVA is doing this. (2) Don't bring the entire campus back all at once. By bringing the vast majority of students back, the ability to socially distance within classrooms is much more difficult. Additionally, this would allow students who are wary of the school's prospects for the fall to opt for an online option, which then saves them the financial burden of finding an apartment, meal plans, parking pass, etc. Stanford and Yale are doing this. (3) Be upfront with students. This is more of a general trust issue with the university, but it is directly related to dealing with the virus. Just look at the example of the administration refusing to provide the Breeze with data on the virus the other day and then writing a completely tone deaf letter in their own defense after receiving backlash. Also, instead of the emails from Alger's secretary, the community should be getting daily updates from President Alger assuring everyone that they are committed to their plan and believe it has a chance of working.",2020-08-28 23:03:00,59

comment,"Question: if JMU isn’t handling things well, which higher education institution is? Who has the model solutions? If you were a decision maker, how would you navigate these times?","I’ve thought a lot about this so I wrote a novel... A few ideas: (1) Perfect World — Higher ed goes all online for fall with external financial support. Colleges and universities apply for government money (just like banks and businesses have received in the past) to ensure they are able to open in the spring. Furloughed service staff are partially paid through these loans/grants and partially through unemployment. Higher ed institutions use this time to build highly robust return-to-classroom models for winter & spring semesters (depending on calendar.) Will there be job loss? Yes. Will there be financial inequality? Yes. Will some students be stuck in shitty home-life situations? Yes. I can definitely see a place in this model for allowing some students to live on-campus in low-density housing. I can even imagine figuring out how to bring back a few folks who need to be doing in-person work (labs etc.) If you’ve got far fewer folks on campus, you can control population outbreaks better. RIGHT SO acknowledging that THAT ship sailed back in May and is reliant on state and Federal funding that we won’t get... (2) Make It Work — Move as many classes online as possible, especially large lecture classes. There is excellent learning tech available for this to make such classes highly interactive. Use as much of it as possible. In my experience, profs are often highly motivated to do this. They LIKE teaching and they LIKE students and they WANT to help things go well for everyone! For students who need to return to campus for personal (home life, visa issues, etc) or educational reasons (lab access, studio access), provide low-density housing and periodic surveillance testing. Have a workable plan that EVERYONE KNOWS AND UNDERSTANDS to quarantine folks if needed...don’t stick them in dirty rooms with lemons for dinner. (#nyudinner). But what if you really want butts in seats to make that sweet sweet tuition money... (3) The Cornell Model. Friend’s kid is at Cornell and things seem to be going okay there with in-person classes. I know that the CDC scaled back its testing guidelines, but colleges and universities present special challenges because of confined, heavily trafficked spaces like dining halls. Cornell tested folks arriving on campus so that those who tested positive could self-quarantine. They bought back students in waves, again to help contain any potential outbreaks and to ensure they were prepared for a sudden batch of very sick students. They plan to continue surveillance testing of portions of the student body. (I would suggest they add faculty and staff to that.) AFAIK they are also doing wastewater testing of dormitories. COVID persists in bodily waste, so if a bunch of folks in a dorm are asymptomatic but positive? You can use the wastewater results to do targeted testing. I understand that, just like in the general population, there’s going to be a certain number of new COVID infections. However, proactive testing could greatly reduce the spread of infection and, by extension, the risk of severe sickness and death. I think the key factors for a successful return to campus are (a) surveillance testing of because of high population density and interactions at places like dining halls, (b) having a workable plan for quarantine that everyone understands, and (c) an understanding of how shitty ‘hybrid teaching’ really is. If anybody is unclear about (c) I suggest attending a class where a prof is lecturing in a space not meant for instruction (like, say, a music auditorium) and said prof needs to both engage the class in front of them AND the class watching from home. Big surprise, it’s a nightmare. /steps off soapbox/ /Begins day drinking/",2020-08-29 10:11:06,12

They’re $4 each on amazon and you can disinfect them with heat and then wear them for multiple days.,2020-08-15 00:40:58,-6
comment,JMU is the greedy villain in the dystopian novel that is our lives,I’m actually not too paranoid about getting COVID myself. I’ve spoken with my doctor and she said I’m not particularly high risk. I am worried about other people getting it. Especially the elderly population of Harrisonburg and wherever students return to and transmit the virus.,2020-08-15 00:46:18,6

comment,good food,"El Sol has the best chips and guac I've ever had. La Morena and El Charro also have really good Mexican food (especially the arroz con pollo at El Charro). The sticky shrimp at Billy Jack's is better than the sticky nuggs in my opinion. Cuban Burger is my personal favorite restaurant downtown. If you want cheap Japanese food, Mr. Sato Express is pretty good for the price. O'Neill's has regular food, but their appetizers and desserts are the best things on their menu. Capital Ale House is pricey, but the food is really good. Macado's has great sandwiches.",2020-08-05 13:54:13,3

comment,good food,"Harrisonburg honestly has a great variety of food. I wish I could have stayed longer to support these local businesses because they were a very big part of my JMU experience. Here are some of my faves: Sakura #10 (the entrees and hibachi are yummy!!) Thien An Pho (just opened last fall across from Walmart on east campus, has great pho and Vietnamese food) Oriental Cafe (very authentic Chinese food, probably best Chinese I’ve ever had) Sushi Village (all you can eat sushi!! Literally you pay $25 and can order whatever appetizers, hibachi and sushi you want. It’s cheaper during lunch too but less variety) J-Petal/Poke Alakai (they’re both in one space but you can order drinks, rolled ice cream, crepes, and poke which is basically deconstructed sushi in a bowl) Kangnam Style (Korean food truck with delicious and cheap korean bbq!!) At Thai (just opened and is probably the best Thai in Hburg) Mr. Sato’s (casual Japanese and sushi burritos!!!!) Taj of India or Taste of India (can’t decide which Indian place I like more because they’re both tasty) Vito’s (delicious pizza and free garlic knots) El Sol ($1 street tacos on Tuesdays, can’t beat it) Tacos El Primo (food truck near the korean food truck with authentic tacos, burritos and quesadillas) Latin’s Flavor (downtown with inexpensive Latin American food. Pupusas are bomb af and they do all you can eat tacos for $7 on Wednesdays) The Sub Station Mexican Grill (it’s kinda down S Main but their tacos and margs are so good) Paleteria La Mexicana (Mexican desserts!! I crave the strawberry agua fresca almost daily) Clementines (best shrimp and grits and Irish coffee) Crosskeys (a vineyard but has a great brunch) I probably have a bunch more recommendations but these are some of my favorites that I remember. My goal was to try every restaurant in Harrisonburg and I could have done it before I graduated if it weren’t for COVID. :(",2020-08-05 23:45:16,3
comment,good food,Salgado's Pupuseria y Taqueria is a former food trunk turned restaurant that hands down has the best tacos and pupusas In town.

Bill Bolling to help create a job for himself at the school, permitting him to write parts of his own job description.

post,Stolen Nintendo Switch,"Stolen Nintendo Switch I live at The Mill apartments in Harrisonburg, and my car was broken into last night. The only thing of note that was taken was a Nintendo Switch OLED. I have already deactivated it and the accounts on it, but if anyone sees a Switch OLED (Legend of Zelda: Tears of the Kingdom special edition) for sale on Facebook marketplace or at a pawn shop, please reach out! I’m willing to pay for it back. And if the person who stole it sees this, I’ll pay you for it back, and I won’t involve the Police. I just want to play Zelda lol",2024-09-04 09:44:22,37
comment,Stolen Nintendo Switch,"Call up the Gamer Oasis and Rocktown Games and the local GameStops. If they are trying to flip your Switch quickly for cash, these are the places that they would most likely do so. Also, check eBay and change the setting to “Local, within 25 miles”. That would likely show anyone trying to flip a Switch in the local area. Good Luck with the search!!",2024-09-04 09:55:49,33

post,Follow-up: Bad Experiences at JMU,"Follow-up: Bad Experiences at JMU Here's the link to the initial post: [https://new.reddit.com/r/jmu/comments/vzvqev/bad\_experiences\_at\_jmu/](https://new.reddit.com/r/jmu/comments/vzvqev/bad_experiences_at_jmu/) So, I made that post two years ago when I was going into my junior year. I walked the stage a couple of weeks ago and thought it would be relevant to do an update! The post was rather controversial lol. There were a lot of ""I bleed purple"" and ""you're the problem"" type comments. But more importantly, there were a lot of kind people on the thread who threw out advice and shared their similar experiences, which helped more than I can really put in words. If any of those people reach this post, thank you so much! You all are the types of people that kept me going these past four years. The follow-up is that yes, I still did not have a good time at JMU. A lot of the reasons I list in the initial post stayed relevant and I still stand by most of what I said there. I am definitely less heated about it now and feel kind of numb to the whole experience. I'm just glad I got the degree then the heck out of there. Bottom-line is, some people just aren't suited for big school antics, and I am one of them. JMU could be a great fit for some, it just wasn't for me. There are a lot of very kind people there; staff, students, etc. I think there is a broader problem with big university culture that really needs to be addressed, but a lot of it is just chocked up to ""kids being kids"". It's not just JMU- it would've been a problem I encountered at any big school. But I could make a whole different post about that in another sub. There were a whole shitstorm of things that made it hard for me to find my way at JMU. To all the baby dukes and those making their way through, good luck!! Try to approach it more positively than I did. I found a good job with my degree, and could not be happier with the opportunities that my education has provided me. If things get tough, just remember that it's temporary and not for nothing.",2024-05-30 01:12:45,38

comment,Follow-up: Bad Experiences at JMU,"Congrats to you!! I think it’s cool how mature and level headed you approach this. You’re totally right, big college is not right for a lot of people, and sometimes just “giving it time” and “sticking it out” isn’t the way to go.

comment,Follow-up: Bad Experiences at JMU,"Sounds like the situation worked out well enough. You finished, and you got what you came for. Sorry that you don't have fond memories of the place where you spent the last four years of your life, but at least it's over now and you can move on. College life really isn't everything, and there's a great big world out there for you to explore and find your niche in, and you never have to look back to JMU if you don't want to. And most importantly, you never have to attend a stupid JMU function ever again, nor give them another dime again if you don't want to. For all of the bad experiences, though, I am halfway surprised that you attended graduation. I had a poor experience at JMU myself for very different reasons than you, and I was so thoroughly *done* with the place by the end that I skipped out on graduation with no regrets.",2024-05-30 09:56:15,6

But I don’t remember seeing as many on campus students needing to be taken from campus for medical reason regarding alcohol as a freshman 8 years ago as I see happening now. It’s definitely always been normalized to drink in college but I think it’s progressively becoming more of an expectation and pressure to do so than it was before. And I think a lot of students now really want the social aspect of it even more post Covid. But that is just my opinion,2024-02-29 13:29:14,6

We don't want someone to get to that point in the first place, but if they do, they need to get the help that they need right away. It's also why I believe that if it gets to that point where they need medical attention due to excessive drinking, all punishments should be off the table. If disciplinary consequences become a hurdle in front of getting medical attention for alcohol poisoning, it needs to be done away with. Clearing the way for a person to go get help and have all involved not worrying about ruining their college career because of disciplinary concerns seems more important than discipline at that point. And think about it: the people involved have suffered enough already. We don't need the administration to add insult to injury.",2024-03-01 02:13:34,2

There have been many conversations had on campus as to whether the true meaning of the phrase should be discussed with Alger, but nobody seems to have the heart to break it to him.

post,roaches AND bed bugs at Southview,"roaches AND bed bugs at Southview *****LONG POST**** Hey y’all, me again. I posted earlier this month about an issue in my apartment building at 1093 in Southview (doxxing myself **hard** rn lmao). My housemates and I moved into a DISGUSTING unit this Aug infested with roaches in the kitchen, living-room and a few in our bedrooms. There were roach carcasses and feces in all the cupboards, cabinets, floors, walls, literally everywhere. We had a few ants + a whole ass spider LIVING inside our microwave, and black mold or dust in our air vents. Now, I understand normal ware and tare but this was negligence. We told management and they sent out an exterminator *after* pestering them for a bit. We also had to practically argue with them to send in a cleaning crew to clean our kitchen even though part 3 of [Title 55 of the Code of Virginia](https://vacode.org/2016/55/13.2/2/55-248.13/) literally states that they had to do their part in moving us into a unit that had a clean common area. Well, today we find out that not only did we inherit a unit with a roach infestation, but there are also bed bugs... bed. bugs. we called management and the best they could offer us was to get an exterminator out to us tomorrow but we have to clean everything today........ literally do not have time for that as we all have busy lives and assignments due. so we can’t use our kitchen b/c of roaches (all our food and kitchen supplies have been in our bedrooms) and now we cannot use our bedrooms either... that we’re paying for. I asked Southview to move us into a new unit but they said they will charge us each $200... even though... they moved us into a unit with bed bugs and roaches... Anyways, do y’all know how else we can fight this? Has anyone else dealt with anything similar? We’re honestly so tired of going back and forth and not getting any results. Any help or ideas would be helpful UPDATE: they will charge my roommate that found the bed bugs in his bedroom with the extermination fee 😡😡😡",2020-09-08 19:15:11,39

comment,roaches AND bed bugs at Southview,"Take photos of **everything.** Email your landlord describing the problems in as much detail as possible, and attach the photos. Do this **now**. The longer you wait, the easier it is for your landlord to claim that the problems started after you moved in. In case your landlord tries to dispute any of this down the line, there will be documentation they were aware of the problems. I would be more concerned about the mold than the bugs. Black mold can be a dangerous health hazard, and the problem could require remediation to correct (tearing down drywall, etc.). I cancelled a vacation rental literally last week because there was black mold on every vent in the house. Had the rental company not refunded me, Visa told me they would absolutely initiate a chargeback. It is that serious of a problem. Open the closet where your HVAC is and check for mold in there too. IANAL but apparently you can terminate your lease if there is a black mold problem: http://mold-awareness.org/mold-law-virginia/ If your landlord doesn't fix the issues quickly, you may want to consider consulting a lawyer.",2020-09-08 20:03:15,26

The basement leaks way too much water when it rains and we have mold all in the basement. They have yet to do ANYTHING. I’ve studied so much about tenants rights and gone to the city, but because the house is so old the USBC doesn’t apply to it. However, neither Riner nor the landlord has done anything about mold. My currents roommates don’t care at all so I’m getting out of my lease and they found someone else to take over. As soon as I’m out, I’m going to WHSV, The Breeze, putting up signs around town and more. I want the slumlords that are Paul Riner and these Monger motherfuckers to go down.

Many landlords do not understand the law, and believe they may bill tenants for the cost of bed bug treatment in all situations. However, other than the two situations listed above, there is no legal authority that allows a landlord to require a tenant to pay for the cost of bed bug treatment. Anything in the lease that says otherwise cannot be enforced by the landlord against the tenant.” “What duties do landlords have about bed bugs? Under Code of Virginia §§55-248.13 and 55-225.3, a landlord must do two things. • Comply with applicable building and housing codes affecting health and safety. • Make all repairs and do whatever is necessary to put and keep the premises in a fit and habitable condition.” https://www.valegalaid.org/resource/bed-bugs-in-rental-housing maybe you could use that somehow? not sure since they did offer the exterminator. but i would assume pests would violate some sort of health code.",2020-09-08 19:36:12,10

comment,Its so hard to find friends as an older JMU student,"I’m also a much, much older student (I’m 46 for reference) and the advice of joining clubs and whatnot is fine but honestly not really practical for someone in our age bracket. Bluntly, it’s weird for both sides to be 30 and over hanging out socially with a group of 20 year olds. Most of the connections I have made is with my professors and older graduate students. I am in clubs or professional organizations for my major but I don’t view them as friends in a traditional sense. I really recommend looking outside of classmates and students. Volunteer for non-profits in the area. Start going to meetings of whichever political party you identify with. Get involved in the broader community. I’d think at 30 your living situation is going to be a bit different than your classmates so hosting events (a bbq or something) that you can invite classmates to that is more social in nature is a good way to meet them on a more peer level without showing up to an undergrad party as a full grown adult. Would you want to party with your parents when you were in your 20s? I hope this doesn’t sound too pessimistic but that’s my experience. For me it was about managing expectations and understanding that as a non-traditional student I was not going to have a traditional experience.

However, although breakthrough cases are significantly more likely with the Omicron variant, [more than 98% of patients hospitalized with COVID-19 are unvaccinated.](https://medicalpartnership.usg.edu/covid-19-staggering-statistic-98-to-99-of-americans-dying-are-unvaccinated/) Therefore, although it may sound like deflecting, if you and your family are vaccinated (and assuming they are not immunocompromised and don't possess significant underlying conditions) then you will all be fine. I understand your concern however and wish you the best this upcoming semester.",2022-01-10 13:54:36,4

comment,Hello?? Alger tell us what we want to know,"Everyone was getting sick last semester (some people got covid of course but there was a cold that a ton of people got), and despite wearing a mask everywhere it's pretty much impossible not to get sick (especially with the newly highly infectious strain) because the fact remains that you have to take your mask off to eat and there are always people breathing and eating around you in dining places. I absolutely never leave my dorm for anything apart from going to classes and eating and I still got sick (again, not covid) last semester because people coughed near me while I was eating and such. Anyway, my point I guess is that even if classes become online, it would be hard not to get covid unless people aren't on campus anymore, eating around each other and such. As long as people are in one place with each other, unmasked (which, again, is inevitable in dining halls), illnesses (covid or not) will spread. And keep in mind I sit alone while eating so it's not like someone is directly across from me spreading an illness to me. Since surgical masks are said to not work against omicron I don't know how many protocols can really be put into place, esp. considering the dining hall situation. I mean, people have to eat, you know. :/ The only solution is if classes are completely online and people don't live on campus, but then you're literally paying to be on campus despite not being on campus. Schools could get sued for that or something, which I think is why JMU would be hesitant to transition to online again. It comes down to money in the end, always.",2022-01-11 01:50:49,2
comment,Hello?? Alger tell us what we want to know,Happy to talk about this more next week if you would like. Send me an email - [millertm@jmu.edu](mailto:millertm@jmu.edu) and we can find a time to talk. In general I would be interested in your thoughts about the impact of your two recommendations. What do you feel would be the impact of a booster requirement and what would being online for 3 weeks accomplish. I am legitimately interested as I have been working on this through the break and hearing lots of opinions. Feel free to reach out and we can talk or email me your thoughts.,2022-01-12 12:57:43,2
comment,Hello?? Alger tell us what we want to know,"The issue with requiring boosters outright is that we had enough students get the vax throughout the semester that there’s presumably a good amount that wouldn’t be able to get theirs in a reasonable time.

post,Does JMU have sovereign immunity to class action lawsuits for bringing students back to campus/Harrisonburg?,"Does JMU have sovereign immunity to class action lawsuits for bringing students back to campus/Harrisonburg? I find it awfully bullshit that JMU has done this, and in my opinion, probably should have a lawsuit coming for at least prorated housing, meal plans, tuition, comprehensive fees, and parking at the very least. It's absurd, they either shouldn't have brought us back, or actually bit the bullet, tested EVERYONE (or required a negative test within a week of coming to Harrisonburg) and a quarantine period with no fuckery. I love it how they're like ""oh OSARP and JMU Police/HPD will handle it"" while OSARP can't even figure out what to do with a missing ping pong table and the police fucking dancing with students at a party. The admin is majorly responsible, and not Alger or Tim Miller, but the Board of Visitors. Sure, parties off campus have contributed, but the parties and shit happening in the east campus dorms is kinda ridiculous from what I've heard. Freshmen, I am sorry for the amount of bullshit you have to deal with. Sure, I got forced out of here after six months of a great experience, meanwhile you all get fucked after a week and a half here. I wish that you all could stay, quarantine, and then actually go back to class sensibly. To the administration, I'm not sure if the magic number was 500, or the Zoom contract finally going through, but y'all need help. This stuff wasn't limited to Coronavirus, but we really need reform in the communication not only to students, but to staff and faculty here, because many sound blindsided to this. Overall, I think someone should seriously consider a class action lawsuits against JMU for negligence and putting others at risk for the sake of pure profit.",2020-09-02 13:47:19,39

comment,JMU Advice (wrong answers only),"Quick campus history lesson E-hall similar to D-hall stands for “Eating hall” because you eat food there. Bridgeforth stadium is named for the fourth bridge built from main campus to east campus that collapsed back in 1995 killing two motorists. The fourth bridge was designed by JMU engineering students as a capstone project. Sadly they received an F on their assignment and all became business majors instead. The current bridge is the 5th bridge finished in 1997 to replace the old one. Godwin Hall is named after the Celtic word for “goblin” leading students to suspect that there may be something sinister lying in the building’s basement. The “death stairs” got their name after an exhausted student fell face first from the highest step, tumbled down halfway, landed on the railroad tracks that intersect the stairway, and got hit by a passing freight train. The incident happened back in 2001. Contrary to many students belief the person in question actually survived and had their tuition paid in full. That person later graduated and was later instated as the University’s current president. Their name was John Alger. ISAT stands for “Intense Student Academic Trauma” which is why the conjoined science buildings on east campus are known as “ISAT” Wilson Hall was named by a student poll back in the 2000. Students, still excited after seeing the hit 2000 Movie “castaway” named the hall Wilson to commemorate the famous volley ball from the film that comforted Tom Hanks during the film. To this day every December 7th, students will leave volley balls inside Wilson Hall to commemorate the film’s release The Student Success Center used to be a Hot Topic before being purchased by the University back in 2005 Carrier Library was named after a former JMU President. Mr. Chips was started by an extremely friendly food vendor who used to stand in the center of campus selling random bags of chips purchased from the local convenience store. He constantly asked students to call him “Mr Chips” an too this day nobody knows his real name although some suspect it might’ve been Tim. D-hub isn’t actually a dinning hall on campus, it’s actually just what students used to call D-hall. Older students just pretend they’re different dinning locations to confuse freshman. Don’t fall for their lies!!! Mr Chips was initially designed to be 7 stories tall but, being unable to secure the correct permits, the owner could only build 1 story. JMU’s mascot isn’t a bulldog, but actually the Duke of Worshtishire’s rare albino pug. This is why JMU’s students are known as “the Dukes” The schools fight song was actually written by James Madison back in 1787 after attending the constitutional convention. In the original work he wrote “If an institution should achieve a level of academic excellence such that my name be prescribed to it, let its students recite this chant for the expressed purpose of getting HYPE AS FUCK” -James Madison Harrisonburg is named after Nathaniel Harris who settled the town back in 1893 to try and create his own independent nation. His settlement lasted for 6 months before his government was dissolved forcefully by a government Militia. His state was re-annexed but the city still bears his name. Newman lake is named after Ted Newman who went missing 50 years ago. his body was never found but rumor has it that the dangerous pollutants in the lake have reanimated his corpse. The University to this day dumps over 70 gallons of blue Gatorade laced with chloroform into the lake on a semi-regular basis in an attempt to keep ted Newman’s reanimated corpse sedated. This is what gives the lake it’s Caspian blue coloration.",2020-06-16 12:41:57,1

post,Anyone else dealing with terribly irresponsible roommates?,Anyone else dealing with terribly irresponsible roommates? My roommates decided to come back last week for some reason. I'm immunocompromised and can't go home because my mom is a nurse and was reassigned to her hospital's COVID unit. My roommates go out 2-4 times a day and don't wash their hands before touching everything in the kitchen. For the last month I've only been going out once a week and making sure to sanitize everything I bring into the house. I wear a mask and gloves when I go out because I could die if I get this virus. I've tried talking to them and telling them that I'm immunocompromised but they don't care. I have to scrub down the kitchen with bleach before I can cook anything and at this point I'm just skipping meals and staying in bed all day because I feel so hopeless.,2020-04-23 18:08:23,39
comment,Anyone else dealing with terribly irresponsible roommates?,I'm so sorry you're experiencing this. Please feel free to PM me if you need help with getting meals in a sanitary environment.

comment,I’m an American University student who just got the news that your current president is transferring here. Do you guys like him?,"President Alger is kind, thoughtful, and incredibly smart. He’s not flashy, enigmatic, or ever going to be the most popular president a university ever has, but boy he’ll help you grow. He was the perfect president for JMU in this season of growth. I liked Alger a whole lot as a person, and thought he was the perfect president for this past decade. In a similar way, I thought Linwood Rose was a perfect successor to Ron Carrier, because he could help continue to steward Carrier’s vision, while letting the university grow beyond the cult of personality that surrounded “uncle Ron”, and into the JMU that was ready to grow beyond them both. Alger was a strong outside perspective who brought a lot of legal and financial sense to the higher education perspective that JMU needed to grow. He’s done that job, and now we need someone who can be the energizing and engaging personality to drive the JMU culture forward. (He was really good at knowing who we was and who he wasn’t, which as other commenters have pointed out, is why Tim Miller is such a great person for his role as VP and truly being the personable Administrative Face). I mean this in the best way, Alger is a lovable nerd, and was never going to be that charismatic leader, but he did incredible work laying the institutional foundations over the last 12 years that makes this a strong and desirable job for anybody who wants to bring their energy to the next chapter of JMU’s life. Good leaders know when they are the right fit for a particular season and great leaders know how to discern when that season is over and move on. I think he’s doing just that. As soon as I saw the announcement, I told my wife (also a JMU alum) that I thought American was a perfect fit for him with his background and academic specialty in higher education law. Then I read his letter to the university where he said not only exactly that, but talked about the personal connections there. It’s genuinely the perfect place for him, and American is primed to grow in a lot of the ways JMU did! He said, “American University has an academic profile that mirrors my deep interests in national and global policy, public service and law. Mary Ann and I met just down the street from American University at National Presbyterian Church, which was where I proposed to Mary Ann, where we were married and where our daughter, Eleanor, was baptized. Mary Ann and I both lived in the Washington metro area for over a decade as we were beginning our professional careers and we have always maintained close professional and personal ties there. It is as though our lives are now coming full circle.” Enjoy President Alger! You’re getting a good one, and JMU has benefited greatly from his tenure.",2024-03-19 09:34:06,7
comment,I’m an American University student who just got the news that your current president is transferring here. Do you guys like him?,"He’s very good behind the scenes. A bit awkward in public relations. He kinda looks uncomfortable in every photo he’s ever taken (not his fault). He used the same speech every year for graduation, stuff like that. He’s definitely a great administrator. Seems like a pretty descent dude. Should be great at the new job I wouldn’t worry. He left a lot of the student stuff to people like Tim Miller and kinda kept to the background. He popped up in videos now and again at events but he wasn’t like SUPER active on campus. Tuition didn’t really go up and he didn’t rock the boat or screw up in any way. Grew a few programs helped the school get more recognition. As a fair weather college president you should have no issues. However a meme that could come back with a vengeance with him leaving.

comment,I’m an American University student who just got the news that your current president is transferring here. Do you guys like him?,"I can't tell if any of the comments here are coming from students or alumni, but I can tell you as Alum that Alger *really* elevated JMU. Went he came on, JMU was classified as a regional school (where the focus is on undergraduate and limited master programs). In his tenure, JMU rose to a national university (where doctoral programs are more widely offered and recognized). This is not a big deal to undergraduates, but it's a huge difference in how well your school is recognized around the country. Essentially, the prestige of JMU has dramatically risen under Alger which you could argue isn't that impressive when you go from very little to some. It still takes a lot of determination and vision which Alger well demonstrated in my opinion. While I was on campus (2013-2017), the school looked practically different from start to finish. The amount of investment that was brought in that time was a really big deal like talking 100s of millions of dollars being poured in education programs, sports, and facilities. Last time I went to JMU, I was pretty shocked at how much NEW there was since I'd left, and you can interpret that investment was based on how well Alger was delivering on his vision. I don't think you'll feel Alger's presence on your campus day to day, as the others have mentioned he's quiet and a little awkward, but your university, without knowing much about it, is in good hands from here. He not culture police or going to make sweeping behavioral reforms like some headmaster, he's being brought in because of his ability to steer a big ship and he doesnt do that by micromanaging student life. If you see him on campus, definitely wave and say hello, he's a super friendly guy and he's got duke dog in him which means he's going to be polite as hell and hold the door open for you. Super disappointed to hear he's leaving tbh. Here's an article JMU wrote about ""Being Seen"" [https://www.jmu.edu/being-seen/where-we-go-from-here.shtml#:\~:text=As%20a%20national%20university%2C%20JMU,scholarship%2C%20research%20and%20creative%20activities](https://www.jmu.edu/being-seen/where-we-go-from-here.shtml#:~:text=As%20a%20national%20university%2C%20JMU,scholarship%2C%20research%20and%20creative%20activities)",2024-03-18 14:11:03,27

comment,I’m an American University student who just got the news that your current president is transferring here. Do you guys like him?,"Good response, however as an alumni I’d argue it had ‘little prestige’ before he got there. The school has historically received more applicants for available slots than other competitive schools and its reputation has been cited for years in various annual ‘best schools’ categories such as US News & World Reports, Kiplingers & others. I met Pres Alger about 3 years ago while walking through the arboretum during a visit & had a very nice chat with him for 5-10 minutes.",2024-03-18 16:00:14,8

Do you guys like him?,">I’d argue it had ‘little prestige’ before he got there I don't diagree with you either, my point was really it's a much easier ride from a little to some than some to more if that makes sense. Like you get a lot of output from early input because there wasn't much to start with. JMU had a lot going for it at the start of his tenure, but notably more when he left. I don't have an expert opinion on how much prestige it has, but I can say that people know JMU when i say it now, but when i was a student and said it outside of VA, NJ, NC, PA, and NY it was like 15% people would know about it.",2024-03-18 16:08:33,6

comment,Why did you choose JMU?,"I graduated a long time ago (early 90s) so i know my experience is dated. I got into uva but chose JMU because when i toured it i just felt like people were “normal” and down to earth. Wouldn’t change a thing and ended up getting into a top 10 law school so the education I received was a good one. Fast forward and three of my kids have gone to JMU. All very different personalities — one, an extrovert and life of the party. Another is an introvert and pretty religious. The third, super studious. They have all loved it, and easily found their “crowd”. With 20K students there is something for everyone. But here’s the important part, and what i have always loved about JMU: no one ever felt excluded or looked down on by the other crowd. I think there was and still is a lot of acceptance and kindness and space for “you do you”. I’ll also add that the alumni network is very robust. Lots of us, all over and in all fields, who have a lot of loyalty for the school.

comment,Why did you choose JMU?,"I chose JMU because they gave me much more financial aid than W&M. From my experience, there are it’s ups and downs. The food has gradually gone down since I was a freshman in 2018, but D and E Hall still remain consistent. There’s a lot of pretentious people that come from wealth (e.g. most of Jersey, LI, NoVa) but there are also down to earth, genuine kids who value their education and building friendships. College of Business, Nursing, and it’s Comp Sci programs are probably the strongest out of the rest of the areas of studies because of how much $ they receive, the rapid growth, and numerous opportunities to get real, hands-on experience. As for the rest, it’s completely up to you to get what you want out of your education (e.g. you aren’t forced/advised to do research if you’re a STEM major, but highly recommended to build your resume). Greek life is an expensive scam with superficial relationships and the whole “networking” thing isn’t real (speaking from experience, networking was one of the main reasons why I wanted to join and I, as well as others from different orgs, got 0 connections). Although there’s different ethnic/culture orgs, JMU does lack diversity and you won’t find any minorities around (even tho Alger spends a lot of time talking on how we’ve “grown” in diversity but I’ve only seen Casper the ghosts walking around campus everyday).

So loud that shakes my bed so I can’t sleep. In all seriousness, if you are not a social person who likes to party, you will NOT fit in at JMU. Please don’t make the same mistake I made. I’m almost a year in and I’ve joined 4 clubs and a sorority yet I have never felt more alone in my life. The people are not friendly like everyone says.

comment,Why did you choose JMU?,"My decision to go to JMU was kind of on a whim. I got accepted into every school I applied to, and visited each. They all gave me similar financial aid and I didn’t really like one campus above another, so I just made a decision. My experience at JMU has not been good. Most of these comments tell positive stories, but I have had an awful experience. I entered my freshman year at JMU in 2020, so the cards weren’t stacked in my favor. My freshman year was very spotty, and I never had the chance to really make friends due to the constant changes in my living/learning situation due to Covid. Aside from the hurdles of Covid, I don’t like the school. The people are nice, yes, but it’s become overwhelmingly clear to me that the social standard is drinking and partying. It’s extremely difficult to make friends if that’s not your jam, which is my case. I have made a few friends, but overall have felt isolated and ignored. I find the overall vibe on campus mimics high school. You don’t have much social value if you aren’t in a sorority or frat. It’s almost clique-y, despite the sheer volume of people. The focus is not on your education, it’s on partying and social networking. I sometimes wonder if other colleges are so far removed from the educational part of campus, and I’m almost embarrassed that I go to a school that doesn’t care that the education is what we’re there for. What we pay for. I’ve lost sight of my education at times, because NO ONE is really academically focused and that becomes the culture. It’s not my scene. I regret my decision to attend JMU every single day, I wish I had made different decisions and it pains me that I will spend many years paying off debt for the worst 4 years of my life. I wouldn’t recommend JMU to anyone who asked. Unless you’re a stereotypical frat boy or sorority girl, then you’ll fit right in. JMU is not a queer-friendly place, it’s not a place for any unique person. It’s for cookie-cutter rich kids who don’t care about their education and can always rely on daddy’s money. I’m just ranting at this point, but I have had an awful experience. If you’re considering JMU, try and spend time there before you make any decision. Like I said, I would give anything to change the decision that I made. While there are plenty of people who have a great time, here’s a reality check: it’s definitely not for everyone. It’s not a utopia like people portray it, and it’s certainly a place where you can get lost in the crowd and never found. Context: I am a current undergraduate student",2022-07-15 14:10:49,1

The faculty genuinely care about your success, and it's easy to make friends simply by talking to someone in a class you're taking.

comment,Why did you choose JMU?,Okay I feel the party bit isn’t really true. I’m not super super social and I’ve only been to one party (I didn’t stay very long there either) and I’ve found I fit in fine. You just have to find the people you get on with. Not everyone parties and they don’t have to party. I’m sorry this has been your experience. I’ve never done a sorority or a club but I’m in the MRDs and I’ve met nothing but kindness. I’ve had people talk to me in dining halls that I don’t know. I have friends within my major and outside. It took me over a year to find my people (mainly Covid because I only lived in a res hall for a semester and didn’t get out much).

comment,Why did you choose JMU?,"Very much agree. The drinking thurs-sat is what makes it bearable. I’ve noticed a lot of people that are fake-kind and hard to really get along with on a deep personal level. Probably 80% of the students seem to have the same “everything is great” school-spirit mindset, the same political views, the same hobbies and affinities, and the same level of social maturity once you dig a little deeper. It’s a very judgmental high schoolish feeling if you wanna fit in with the crowd and it’s pretty bad. It’s hard to meet interesting people unless you really search. Also after moving off campus it’s really hard to socialize. Even being in a few clubs it’s hard, after covid everyone has kinda become a bit of a introvert and it’s not the same. Maybe i’m just pessimistic but I feel surrounded by NPCs here, in a town where every restaurant closes before 11pm and it’s hard to get decent mental health resources to help with my pessimistic outlook and other problems… Also, outside of JMU, unless you like hiking, skiing, or meth there’s not a lot of redeeming features to the Harrisonburg/shenandoah valley area, the “oh look at the pretty mountains!!!” feeling wears off faster than you think.",2022-03-19 17:19:41,6

comment,Dropping vaccine requirements,"Concerned but there’s a point where it’s just not practical to worry constantly over something you can’t control. I can’t force others to care about COVID the way I do, so all I can do is make sure I’m doing what’s best for me. You can withdraw but I can imagine all VA colleges will make the same decision based off of the new governors mandates. Eventually all colleges will stop requiring COVID vaccines/masks period. Everyone wants COVID to be an endemic so badly. I see why but I am worried we are acting like it’s an endemic too early. :/ but again… what can we do besides keep on living through the consequences of these actions.

comment,Dropping vaccine requirements,"JMU is a super spreader center. it draws people from across the country to a small town. Harrisonburg does not have the infrastructure to support a mass outbreak, RMH is not physically capable if that were to happen. We are seeing the most infectious period of this disease that we've ever seen. to lax tactics now would make the last two years of social distancing and masking useless. being vaccinated is not immunity. at the end of the day, I'm far more concerned for my hometown than whatever politics JMU is playing here. The houseless who can't quarantine away without dying in the snow, the poultry plant workers living paycheck to paycheck who if they get sick they either get fired or work while sick, the elderly of the city who will just die if they get it, the kids I went to school with who could face permanent disabilities from long covid... one day we can go back to pre covid, maybe, but we are not close to that yet, we'd be putting so many many many lives in possible jeopardy. wearing a mask and minding personal space is such a minor thing to ask to keep people alive and healthy. I've lived in this town for nearly 21 years and grew up seeing JMU and it's students trash this town and generally not give a shit about us locals. we have to live here year round, and if you catch covid here, spread it around, get better and leave, you might not get your families sick, but you're gonna get my community sick. if people followed the mandates and restrictions in the first place, maybe we could go back to normal tomorrow. but to this very day JMU students don't know how to wear a mask. if we scrap all restrictions now, not a single JMU student will genuinely follow 'suggestions', and the locals going to be the ones paying for it.",2022-02-02 00:39:57,13

comment,Dropping vaccine requirements,"Genuine answer: as the virus mutates and becomes less devastating to a large portion of the population, which- to an extent- we’re already seeing happen. Hospitals are still packed in many parts of the country with COVID patients and as a result are unable to take proper care of other patients who come in with emergency medical situations. If people get vaccinated, they are more likely to be able to ride out the virus at home and medical services aren’t over-expanded.

The feeders are aware of the health issues and they try their best to take care of what they can. There is a vet that works with them from time-to-time but they try not to trap them to take them in unless absolutely necessary (the more you use that option, the more wary they become of it).

comment,Who’s caring for the Quad cats this summer? And what happened to the other cat?,They were at the corner of Madison Drive and the sidewalk that leads up to Burrus. (Not far from where their feeding station and cooler thing is.) Jimmy is usually visible because he likes to beg for treats. Dolley likes to hide in the bushes there. I called her this morning and she came out to see me!,2021-05-20 13:46:19,3
comment,Who’s caring for the Quad cats this summer? And what happened to the other cat?,Good to know their cooler shelter is still there!

comment,Who’s caring for the Quad cats this summer? And what happened to the other cat?,"You're a good person! The cooler shelter is awesome - they love it in the bitter cold! It's a great design - the baffle is a nice touch to keep them cozy. Right now it's to the side a bit (by the west side entrance of Burruss) because JMU landscaping took out the giant bushes in front of Burruss. Once new shrubs are put in front of Burruss, the cooler shelter and the feeding station will (I think) be moved back to where they were.",2021-05-20 21:43:29,2

post,Should I stay home for the rest of the semester?,"Should I stay home for the rest of the semester? I’m a freshman who has had trouble these past few weeks with adjusting to college given the constant back and forth and the crippling uncertainty that JMU’s indecisiveness has fostered. At first, I couldn’t wait to go back to school on October 5th, but my in-person and hybrid professors have increasingly moved their classes online regardless of whether or not we return. I find the prospect of sitting in my dorm all day to do Zoom classes bleak because I’ll still have to pay the hefty price tag of room and board without the comfort of home. On the social side, I’ve found it rather difficult to make friends because everyone in my hall is either cooped up in their rooms as well or way too reckless for my liking. I’ve joined some student orgs but they’re mostly comprised of upperclassmen and all the events are online as well. I’m hoping this will improve in the spring. Could anyone give me *serious* advice on how to proceed with the rest of the semester? I’m just super confused and deterred by the circumstances right now.",2020-09-23 14:06:21,36
comment,Should I stay home for the rest of the semester?,"It honestly all depends on how you feel. After jmu moved their classes online last spring I had to spend every single day in my parents' home trying my very best to focus while the TV was blaring or whilw they talked on the phone. I realized I couldnt ever do that again. Thats why when we moved to online this semester I opted to stay on campus. Im able to focus a lot better and have been just genuinely happier. But that also has to do with being friends with my suitemate and finding time to do what I want at night. However, if you feel like you'd be isolated and depressed and alone sitting in your dorm then by all means stay home. Youll have your parents and/or siblings to converse with but you may not get the comfort and alone time you would like in a college dorm room setting.",2020-09-23 15:12:11,24

comment,Should I stay home for the rest of the semester?,"I’ve said this before, personally if I were in this situation as a freshman I would strongly consider withdrawing from this semester completely, getting the refund, getting a temporary job and coming back in the spring or next fall. Freshman year is an amazing experience when you actually get to EXPERIENCE it. I really feel for freshmen right now, there’s really no good option here. But if you draw the line short of withdrawing from the semester I’d say save the money and do zoom classes. Living in the dorms is fun during normal circumstances, but right now I’d imagine it would suck. No matter what decision you make, just know it’s going to get a hell of a lot better, JMU really is an amazing place and once this starts to pass you will get to actually experience it. Edit: to add- there’s really no downside to waiting a semester, other than you will finish a semester later than you would have. This is a decision that totally depends on your mindset and how you feel and probably a lot of personal factors, but as a freshman I probably would have been concerned with “falling behind” with the prospect of taking a semester off. That should definitely not be a concern, in the end it will make no negative difference whatsoever, but it could help you have a better experience once you do get here, which is a huge positive.",2020-09-23 19:45:03,7
comment,Should I stay home for the rest of the semester?,Don’t know where you’re from but living in Harrisonburg and getting to know the town was just as amazing an experience as being at JMU itself.

comment,Do y'all think Dr. Miller is being sincere or spouting propaganda?,"So I wanted to address Dr. Miller. He is a good guy. I had a few conversations with him back when he came to JMU and assumed the VP role. I brought some major ""issues"" of JMU to the attention of him he cared very deeply about progressing the school forward. He is one of the administration that I know actually cares and it would not surprise me that he made this video on his own accord without being pushed by any others in the administration. I have a strong feeling that the administration was opposed to opening up the school and has been pressured by the fact that all the other VA schools are opening as well. Also of note is that VA schools get a lot of state funding and often they have less control over major decisions than us the ""outside spectators"" may think. With that being said, this opening of JMU is unequivocally wrong. Dr Miller may have the best interests of students in mind, but he does not have the power to stop the opening of the school this fall. I want to remind everyone that this is SPECULATION, I have lots of info about JMU, but I can be wrong about the intentions and interests of JMU, the VA School Board, and other individuals i.e. Dr. Miller.

The Staff and professors are more “valuable” and less “expendables” than students. It Angers me how much staff and professors are just quite and silenced with all this. Yeah i get they would be risking their jobs. Students and Staff and professors shouldn’t be throwing the dice risking getting sick, getting someone sick, hospitalized, or sick to death. JMU students have the numbers but staff and professors have the power. i mean, come on man! this shit is getting people killed, it’s airborne and it has killed friends of mine too. No one cares about the numbers until you see your people dying. This caused a global wide pandemic is not a freaking season allergy or “flu”. The fall semester is not up to us. Apts filled with roommates, public dining, tight buildings, college residences and share bathrooms are goin to be a mess. It’s AIRBORNE. Sad parts is this WILL cause avoidable deaths wether it’s JMU students, Hburg residents, or any of their relatives or even strangers. JMU is ONLY a business, that’s it, they will never care about any of us NEVER. that’s fine bc their a business and we are customers; JMU is NOT our family, it provides a service and that is all. This is only bio security theater. The right choices are never easy; and it was much easier to keep the show going, and invest some dollars to keep everyone a bit tame and less worried, while keeping the bucks coming.

Fellow students, Yes, this is ass. Yes, public schools want our money. Yes, going to school and staying is a nearly impossible task. That being said, there are still measures you can take to keep others safe! If the student body really was pissed off about going to online then...follow the freegan rules!! I think the majority of people are assuming that students are just going to not socially distance and run about willy-nilly, but why does that seem inevitable? I don’t get it. If we reeally cared about staying at school, then we should make it happen. JMU or any school would have no reason to send us home and go to online if there is no covid outbreak, right?

Not to mention the fact that thousands of JMU students have jobs where the mask rules aren’t strict enough. Are they just supposed to quit and be unemployed? But its a moot point because JMU students WILL be having parties. I’ve already seen instagram stories of parties in Hburg and most people aren’t even back yet.

As much as I want to stay on campus, the reality is that JMU is pushing because they need the money, all colleges are, once the numbers start to spike 3-5 weeks in (not just JMU but all over the state and Harrisonburg) they’ll be forced to rethink it and send us home, at least that’s what I hope will happen. 🤷‍♀️",2020-08-02 11:56:57,3

comment,"Hypothetically, if the student population does everything right for a few weeks, there is a chance we could stay??",This is produced through a mathematical model I made. I will walk through the model here. Lets assume (Based on CDC guidelines) that if someone is wearing a mask they can be infected but can not infect others. For our model lets say a mask wear exposes on average 1.1 people per day (This is low). Lets also amuse people who are infected will start infecting others after 1 day. Lets also assume the population is of infinite size because I do not want to solve a differential equation (This assumption is OK assuming our numbers do not go above 3000 or 12.5% of the JMU student population). Given this we can model the spread over 7 days from a infected mask wearer as SUM from N=1 to N=7 of N\*1.1 which is about 30.8 people in a week. Now lets say that we have a anti masker go to a single class at JMU. They will expose 26 people in a average class (Assuming no class size reduction for JMU). If that anti masker was infected AND everyone else wears masks then we can model the spread over 7 days by multiplying 25 (26 minus the anti masker) by 30.8 (the exposure over 7 days from a mask wearer) which is 770 people in a week. Lets say they also exposed 10 other people while on campus then you can model it by multiplying 35 (25+10) by 30.8 which is 1078 people in a week. If that one anti masker wore a mask to class then only 39.6 people would be infected in a week. The 90% figure i guessed. I was incorrect. Based on this model we have between 796 to 1114 people infected of which only 1 was not wearing a mask. This means over 99.8% to 99.9% of the population of the infected sample were wearing masks in this model. Keep in mind my assumptions in this do have flaws but it is a estimate.,2020-08-03 17:34:41,1

post,Transferring out,"Transferring out Hi, I know I might get downvoted- god forbid anyone says something negative about jmu- but as a freshman, things are really not working out here for me on so many levels, excluding academics thankfully. I don't really want to spawn a negativity post, so if you transferred out or have considered it *for non-academic reasons*, please dm me about your experience. Especially if you're either POC or OOS or generally introverted. &#x200B; It might be hard for the right crowd to see this, but I've exhausted all my options. The opportunity to be here is amazing and I've met great people, but it's not for me and I've really tried my hardest to make the best out of a difficult situation. Thanks for reading. &#x200B; got accepted to another school! yay and cheaper tuition too, so :) Also sorry if this is soliciting. I know some sub-reddits don't like asking people to DM the OP- I can take it down.",2023-11-26 01:08:01,36
comment,Transferring out,"Good for you in recognizing that JMU isn’t for you as a freshman. College is such an important experience, being proactive in getting the most out of it is great. I was a POC at JMU years ago; it definitely was challenging at times but I eventually found a good set of friends, many of whom I’m still in touch with today.

comment,Transferring out,"Many many years ago - I left JMU and then returned. I learned that making friends, feeling connected, and being happy is hard no matter where you are. JMU had something special that I didn’t realize/appreciate until I left. So, I returned and had a great experience. Not every school is right for everyone, and your choices and feelings are valid - just a gentle reminder that wherever you go, there you are - that was a lesson I learned. Best of luck to you - trust yourself and you will make a great choice.",2023-11-26 09:49:13,10

No judgment your way, mind you, maybe I just never felt the school spirit strongly enough to condemn someone for realizing they didn't want to be there. As others mentioned, good for you in recognizing early that you want something else for yourself. Whatever combination of JMU, Harrisonburg, and the Valley which led you to the conclusion you need to be elsewhere, I hope you find a place you find fitting. I've had several friends over the years, during my time at the school and after, that made the same decision.

comment,Transferring out,"I mean, social life is a part of it, but that's not it *entirely*. I'm so proud of how much JMU has been a great environment to get out of my shell as someone who's usually incredibly timid. That kind of environment is rare, yet at the same time it doesn't really change anything for me. I know it's *huge* to some people. I was so happy at the start, but that's really start to dissipate into regrets. I'll take that lesson to heart, I might struggle in my other college, but I feel like I'd prefer that compared to being here. I'm glad you eventually found yourself in the right place- I hope it'll be the same for me. Thanks for the encouragement.",2023-11-26 11:43:58,3

comment,Transferring out,"Thanks for the suggestions, but I have no issues with the sizing. Diversity, ehh slightly. I just have another school, roughly the same size, that pretty much resolves a majority of my qualms about being at JMU with the added benefit of being in my home state. I'm a POC, but I'm not black. I feel like an HBCU wouldn't be much of a difference. &#x200B; This is kind of a tangent, but I never understood why HBCUs would be called diverse. I thought diversity meant a spread of different backgrounds, not the same one. Even if I found a school that was a majority asian or hispanic, or any other background, I would still not call it diverse...A majority is still a majority to me. Plus, aren't universities supposed to accept all people regardless of race???",2023-11-26 12:15:13,2

For one, I really don't like living in this area. I've been around college towns and more rural towns which are fine- but I abhor Harrisonburg. There's hardly anything to do without a car and with the cruddy bus system that doesn't even cover the area. I also wont be able to get a car anytime soon. I hardly leave the campus because of this. To me, being able to actually do things off campus is important to me. Then the cost. I'm out of state.

post,Ranking JMU Dorms,"Ranking JMU Dorms &#x200B; Hi everyone, I was bored so I decided to make a list ranking the best and worst dorms at JMU. Hopefully, this will be helpful to the students currently looking for housing next semester! &#x200B; 1. **Paul Jennings** \- Paul Jennings is the newest dorm located on East Campus right behind UREC. It is by far the nicest dorm on campus since it brands new with awesome amenities such as private community bathrooms and a convenience store on the first floor for students. PJ is far away from basically everything so you have to be prepared to take a bus or walk. Overall, I would highly recommend students look at this dorm, although the chance for any freshman to get a room is pretty slim. 2. **Skyline Dorms** \- although Location is an important factor when picking dorms, the East Campus dorms are just better. Skyline dorms are also decently new dorms that are right across from E-Hall, which has the best food on campus (not a debate). They have community-style bathrooms that are actually pretty nice, and the dorm rooms are nice and spacious. Skyline is close to the science/engineering buildings, but pretty far from Main Campus, so be prepared to take the bus! 3. **Bluestone** \- Bluestone dorms are right in the middle of Main Campus, so no bus taking will be necessary. Bluestone dorms are also very close to the dining halls and everything else on Main Campus. Most of the Bluestone Dorms have AC and have Jack and Jill bathrooms with another room (4 people per bathroom). Not all Bluestone Dorms are made equal, so know what you’re picking (Hoffman is the best) 4. **Hillside** \- Now we start getting into the Bottom half of JMU dorms. Hillside is basically the older version of Skyline on Main campus. Hillside is in a decent location in terms of food and main campus classes, but the dorms themselves aren’t in the best shape. I would recommend checking out JMU’s website for photos/videos so you know what you’re getting into. These dorms do have AC and are close to the basketball courts, but it's a decent trip to UREC. 5. **Village** \- The village is a highly “controversial” dorm, you will either have a horrible time or an amazing time. I did not have an amazing time which is why I ranked it so low. The village is made up of a bunch of suite-style dorms with semi-private bathrooms, but don’t let that fool you. The village is the oldest set of dorms on campus and it shows. There is AC in the common rooms ONLY, and the Clothes washing situation SUCKS. The village is also the party area of JMU, so be prepared. But, the water does taste really good (Idk why). IMPORTANT - IF YOU GO VILLAGE YOU WILL GET SICK AT SOME POINT. 6. **Lakeside** \- Lakeside is the last resort area, don’t pick this on purpose. There are no redeeming qualities about Lakeside other than its proximity to COB and the friends you will make along the way (you will bond through shared suffering). Overall, definitely research the dorms you want to live in and make the right choice, housing is VERY IMPORTANT, especially if you’re a freshman. It has a huge impact on your college experience so make sure to do your due diligence before selecting a dorm. JMU has great resources for figuring out which dorm will be the best fit for you",2023-04-05 13:07:58,35

comment,Ranking JMU Dorms,"Village is definitely the way to go. Hands down best location on campus, doesn’t take longer than 15 minutes to get anywhere on campus plus the suite style dorms help you make friends and make your rooms feel bigger than they actually are. People complain about the ac but it’s only hot for like 2-3 months throughout the year. Everyone just keeps their door open and the ac in the suite flows into the rooms.",2023-04-05 22:34:07,5

comment,Ranking JMU Dorms,"It is very dependent on your suite-mates and who you share a bathroom with. I had an awful time. Halfway through the first semester there were beer cans in the toilets every Friday night that lasted until cleaning on Monday. My suite mates joined a frat together and were super cliquey and my roommate was addicted to coke. I’ve had a great time at JMU, but living in the Village was one of the worst times of my life. What I listed isn’t a third of what I dealt with. Being in the village is incredibly dependent on getting along with the 4-5 randoms in your suite, and hoping the other 6 sharing a bathroom with you are decent humans.",2023-04-06 01:02:10,3
comment,Ranking JMU Dorms,"The location is nice but that's basically all that the village has going for it. The buildings are old and should've been torn down years ago. If you get bad suitemates it is going to suck, and even if you get good suitemates, the bathroom situation could still be terrible. Housing costs the same no matter where you go so why choose a place that you know isn't nice + risk getting bad suitemates vs choosing a location that is nice where you don't have to worry about suitemates? Not to mention East Campus as a whole has a much better vibe than Main Campus (Village area) although that's just my opinion.",2023-04-06 12:58:36,1

comment,Ranking JMU Dorms,"Second this. The location is great because everything is in walking distance but I absolutely hated the village. The bathrooms were so fucking dirty over the weekend because housekeeping only came on weekdays. I remember I had to use other bathrooms throughout the dorm because I couldn’t stand to piss in front of a pile of puke. The village is great if you like partying every weekend/weekday but I personally couldn’t stand it. I’m a senior now and I know for a fact that half of the people on my floor are actually graduating on time and that’s because they got caught up with those lame ass dorm parties. Another thing that really pissed me off was the fact that my room and board was the same as someone who lived in Jennings or on east campus. It’s a total rip-off. Sure, the village has AC now but everyday I woke up trying to avoid catching the bubonic plague or trench foot from the mysterious substances that bred throughout the bathrooms. Meanwhile, that same rate is the equivalent of living in a hotel at Jennings.",2023-04-06 08:21:29,4

post,JMU Dungeons and Dragons Club,"JMU Dungeons and Dragons Club I’m a freshman at JMU who is also a big fan of DnD. In my search for DnD games at JMU, I discovered the Science Fiction and Fantasy Guild, who have some DnD players, but I still haven’t been able to find a game through them. Seeing that there wasn’t a club dedicated to DnD, I decided that I would have to make my own. I was introduced to DnD through my high schools DnD club, and I had some of my best experiences through that club. I’m going to make my club in a similar way to my high school DnD club. I’m going to make an entire world that anyone in the club can interact with. People in my old club would come to sessions where there are several DMs and who would run separate games. Some people played with the same dm every time, playing through a long story. Others would hop around from DM to DM playing one shot sessions. This is the kind of club I want. Anyone who also wants this, I would welcome help in achieving this, even if it’s just your willingness to join.

comment,Jmu to begin randomly testing 300 students a week in October,"It's surveillance testing, which many universities are doing. The purpose is not to *directly* stop spread, but to get an accurate overall picture of spread on campus and how it's changing over time. Simply looking at tests done at UHC won't provide the most accurate glimpse of spread around campus, because sick students are more likely to get tested (self-selection bias). That is not to say UHC data should be ignored. By doing random surveillance testing, and tracking how that positivity rate changes over time, you get a much more accurate understanding of how pervasive the disease is on campus. A lot better than simply looking at UHC tests. https://sph.umich.edu/news/2020posts/surveillance-testing-gathering-the-data-on-covid-19.html Which begs the question: why didn't they start this in August?",2020-09-18 15:04:11,20

If we take a year off then our loans enter repayment and now it is harder to resume school. The option for students is to keep paying or burn all money we already spent.

Need I say more? How are you going to side with a multi-million dollar institution? We're talking about 18-20 somethings here. Of course they're going to party. The reason people decide to go to a university and not community college is specifically for the social aspects.

VDH says you can’t test out of quarantine. If you come in contact with someone you should quarantine for 14 days. If you develop symptoms you get tested and then isolate for 10 days if you’re positive. If you never develop symptoms you’re done after the 14 days. If you come in contact with someone that’s positive again you do another 14 days. They don’t want you to get tested (in this case) because it takes time for Covid to develop in your system after coming in contact, so testing negative doesn’t necessarily mean you’re safe especially if it’s right after coming in contact with someone.

comment,COVID-19 Testing,"in addition to some points that have already been made, keep in mind that testing is only effective for the time immediately before and after the test has been taken. i currently work for a company that requires employee testing, but in order for it to make much of a difference, we test weekly. even then, there are days in between where exposure could occur. a similar way for JMU to achieve this initial clearance is to ask students to isolate prior to returning to campus (for free!), which they have. also, i don’t know if this is what you were referring to, but i’ve heard of schools sending the test kits to the students’ residences for them to take themselves. we’re not nurses (or not a majority of nursing majors), we don’t necessarily know how to do this. if a sufficient sample is not taken, a “negative” result may as well read “inconclusive.” this would also be a waste of money.",2020-08-01 12:19:08,1

You have to go there and appear in person, but it's NOT TOO LATE to vote! If you're from elsewhere in Virginia and never managed to register in Harrisonburg, it's NOT TOO LATE TO VOTE -- you can still vote absentee in your home town/city by appearing in person TODAY (SATURDAY) - in most municipalities in Virginia the registrar's office will be open until 4ish (a few I looked up are open until 4:30 or 5 - but it varies, be sure to look up your town/county - see below for link to pdf with that info.) &nbsp; If you are ALREADY registered in your hometown, you can drive there and vote absentee there in person tomorrow. TODAY (saturday) IS the LAST DAY to do this. &nbsp; here is a partial list of links , of course not to every city in VA but I'm sure you can look yours up. Here is a PDF - https://www.elections.virginia.gov/Files/Forms/VoterForms/VirginiaAbsenteeBallotApplication.pdf - which will show you the form they will have you fill out when you appear in person at your home town/county's registrar's office -- if you're a student your ""reason code"" for voting absentee will be 1A. &nbsp; That PDF also has phone numbers listed for every registrar office in Virginia, so if you have doubt about they're hours you can give them a ring (or go googling for it, suit yourself : ) ) &nbsp; After you fill out the form they will ask for ID - luckily a student ID at a Virginia college or university will do just fine! But if you'd like to see a list of all possible forms of ID that will suffice, here you go - https://www.elections.virginia.gov/registration/photo-ids-required-to-vote/index.html &nbsp; Then they will give you a ballot and direct you to a voting booth, et viola, you can vote! But TODAY is the LAST DAY TO VOTE ABSENTEE in person in your home town. &nbsp; Unfortunately the deadline has passed to update your registration address so you can vote locally.. but maybe you are from a near-ish place that you can drive to! This is a historic election, hopefully you can make the trek.. just be sure to do it TODAY. Remember the address and phone number for your local registrar's office is right here on the second page of this pdf : https://www.elections.virginia.gov/Files/Forms/VoterForms/VirginiaAbsenteeBallotApplication.pdf be sure to check with them to see how late your particular registrar's office will be open. &nbsp; lastly, if you're from out of state but able to drive home, you can check your home state's policy on early voting/ in-person absentee voting here - https://www.vote.org/early-voting-calendar/",2018-11-03 00:20:12,36

comment,RA’s or anyone: what was your worst roommate story or interaction,My roommate freshman year started off ok but he very quickly started going down hill. I had 8 am classes most days and would wake up at 6 and he would come back to the room to sleep at 2 am and then wake up at 2pm so I never got more than maybe 4 hours of sleep at a time. He would play one song on a speaker on loop at full volume for the entire day and leave it playing even while he wasn't there. He routinely would steal things from my desk. He never did his laundry so it would smell awful and he would get one of the girls on our floor to do it for him. The worst thing he ever did was come back to the room drunk one night at 3 am during the dead of winter and decide it was too warm in the room for him. Mind you I slept next to the window. You can imagine my surprise to wake up to realize that the window was completely open on a night that was 13°F and my feet numb from the cold and nearly frostbitten. Fuck that dude.,2022-05-15 22:31:19,29

By the end of the semester the kid had OD’d twice and by the next year or so he dropped out or got kicked out.

comment,RA’s or anyone: what was your worst roommate story or interaction,"My roommate and I got along pretty well my sophomore year with the exception of one insanely odd thing he would do. He set an alarm every morning for 7:30 AM on his phone and then put his phone under his pillow. This muffled the noise enough to where he always slept through it but it would wake me up as a light sleeper. I would then have to try and make enough noise to wake him up so he would turn it off. Then, after he turned it off, HE WOULD GO BACK TO SLEEP! Like why even set the damn alarm them?",2022-05-16 00:15:18,7
comment,RA’s or anyone: what was your worst roommate story or interaction,"I was in Rockingham Hall. I roomed with a dude who rushed the Pike, which was a yikes in general. One night, he brought a very drunk girl home. I went to the common area with my laptop to let him do his thing. At 1:30am he rushes into the common area in his underwear and says, ""Dude, the condom broke, what do I do?"" I suggested plan b, and he said alright and asked me to drive him to CVS. I said, ""no, go in the morning, I'm gonna go to bed."" We go back to the room, her passed out in his bed, and I try to sleep. He is calling his friends, freakin' out, saying things like, ""The condom broke! I don't even know her name!"" She half consciously slapped him with the back of her hand. I eventually fall asleep and have a weird dream. It is a golden circle broken into 3 parts, rotating slowly. Black smoke starts to quickly take over and I awake in a panic to the girl naked climbing into my bed. I said, ""Oh god! Go away."" That was the fastest I've ever said words after waking up. She was gone the next morning and never saw her again.",2022-05-15 21:38:15,22
comment,RA’s or anyone: what was your worst roommate story or interaction,"Freshman year my roommate never left our room and never cleaned anything.

The worst was when I got home and there was bloody tissues all over the floor and her bed, a sheet pan with dirty socks on her desk, and a jar of Alfredo sauce in her closet. Her entire collection of clothes was on her floor. Other than being gross though she was pretty non-problematic. We had maybe two conversations the entire year.",2022-05-16 14:56:08,5

comment,RA’s or anyone: what was your worst roommate story or interaction,"Not me, but a close friend, also at JMU. Had a guy who literally would watch Anime all day and never leave his room. He hardly went to class. He binged the entirety of One Piece (apparently over 1000 episodes) and would play Call of Duty 10+ hours a day. He wouldn't even go the bathroom and would piss in cups. Shower maybe once a week. The dorm smelled like shit and my friend was threatened with a knife when he finally called the guy out on it. He then also got mad that my friend was talking to a girl on the next floor and said that she had a crush on him even though they never talked. He asked my friend to stop talking to the girl because they were going to go out. She literally never spoke a word to this dude. Thankfully, this only lasted a semester and the guy failed out.

comment,RA’s or anyone: what was your worst roommate story or interaction,"I got into a car accident with my one roommate last semester. She was driving, I was a passenger, and we ended up getting t-boned at an intersection. Fast forward, I was taken via ambulance to the hospital and had a concussion, bruising, and was out of school for 3 weeks (I went home). I got hit by a truck and smacked my head off the glass. After the car accident before I went home, my roommates were mad at me because I kept talking about my physical health and wasn't consoling my roommate about her totaled car. Meanwhile, she had 0 injuries (went to work, school, etc the next day, never took any pain meds, etc). She had 0 insurance on the vehicle as well so it made her upset that I was only ""caring about myself"". Yes, I got hit by a truck, literally. They also said it was rude of me to obtain a lawyer against the guy who hit us (we were turning on a green arrow) because my parents can't pay the medical bills, especially since my dad just beat cancer. None of it was even against her. The best part was that they made a groupchat talking bad about me when I was at home recovering. Not once did I get a text asking how I was, but they expected me to reach out to her and console her about her car. Eventually they all FaceTimed me 5 days before we were supposed to move in and held an ""intervention"" to my face and said why they didn't like me - which was I was too focused on my own health after the accident and asked me to move out.",2022-05-16 21:34:56,5

I also remember seeing a flyer that advertised him cleaning and packaging up Deer carcasses that you had hunted. So this sounds like the same man and you could check at the Farmers Market or try Byler’s Barns.

post,Is JMU worth it?,"Is JMU worth it? Hey guys, I’m going into my senior year of high school in Chicago, Illinois, and my college search is pretty much coming to a close, one school that stood out was JMU. I figured if I wanted an unbiased opinion, Reddit would be the place, so here’s the question. Do you guys like JMU, and what about it do you specifically like? More in importantly, what are you major dislikes about the school? I’d just like to get the feel for what the students actually think, not what some admissions counselor is paid to say. Thanks a lot",2020-07-26 14:33:39,36
comment,Is JMU worth it?,"When it comes to any college, what that school provides for you and what you can get out of it (specific programs, faculty, facilities, etc) are some of more important things to make it “worth it.” After that, you need to feel comfortable there. So I guess that’s the first question to ask yourself there. How does JMU stand out among the other schools you are looking at? When it came to my major and future career plans, (being an out-of-state person as well) it was a great fit and I loved my time there. What I liked about it when I was there was the “small school feel with big school opportunities” —the school has certainly grown over the last 10-13 years. For those that have a love of JMU it usually runs deep.",2020-07-26 14:44:32,36
comment,Is JMU worth it?,"* Pros: * JMU overall has so much to offer. There is a constant focus on our facilities and how they can better use spaces to benefit students (both Showker and Jackson halls are undergoing expansion renovations) as well as the athletic business side of JMU. * JMU professors are overwhelmingly instruction-focused versus research focused like many other schools, meaning their first priority is their courses/students, and then research is used to supplement that. Many other institutions are the opposite. * There is also a large emphasis on student development university-wide. On campus jobs prepare students for real, full time jobs by providing opportunities for peer leadership and developmental workshops, and I can say that these have greatly helped me. * Cons: * As a freshman, it is very hard to find your spot if you are not in Greek life. Once rush happens in the early weeks of September, there becomes a prevalent Greek life/non-Greek life divide. The solution to this is to GET INVOLVED. Don't wait until your sophomore or junior year to join organizations or get jobs and use the excuse of ""I'm transitioning into college so I don't want to distract myself with extracurriculars until sophomore year."" You will thank yourself down the road when you have met amazing people through the opportunities JMU has to get involved (pre-professional fraternities, sport clubs, etc.) * As others have said, there is a large emphasis on athletics. Football players walk around like they run the place and then sit in class and can barely answer simple questions. I'm sure this is true for most football schools too, though. * There is also a large emphasis on certain majors over others. Namely, business majors often have access to resources that other departments do not (they underwent an expansion that basically doubled their space with brand new classrooms, labs, etc). Meanwhile, ""quad majors"" (arts and letters, math, education) are often spending all of their time in buildings that have bad wifi, need better A/C or heating, and technology services that are paid less attention to than other better funded departments. Along with this comes a generally accepted idea among some students that they are better than others simply because of their major. * Finally, almost every student has experienced a tough enrollment. Courses and instructors are limited, and classes fill up fast. This is not unique to JMU though and I have always ended up getting every requirement I've needed, so it has worked out for me at least. I hope this helps. Overall, JMU is absolutely a wonderful place and I'd recommend it to anyone. Harrisonburg and the surrounding area are awesome and a great way to expand your horizons past what you're used to in your hometown.",2020-07-26 17:06:14,15
comment,Is JMU worth it?,"If you're used to a big city, Harrisonburg is definitely going to feel limited. It's a pretty small town. That comes with benefits, for sure, but be prepared for a culture shock. There's a lot of wealth at JMU, which can feel really alienating if you come from lower middle class like I did. But the best part of the school is how diverse it is. I didn't really fit in with the (sometimes obnoxious) greek life crowd, but was able to find my own people who I got along with wonderfully. The music scene is pretty great for such a small area, there's always lots of parties, but not a ton of nightlife compared to other colleges. That being said, Harrisonburg is a pretty vibrant little town. There's always tons of events on campus that are pretty fun, plus a club for pretty much everything. The quality of my classes far exceeded my expectations (this may not hold true for every major; make sure that you look at reviews of the programs you're interested in).",2020-07-26 17:25:35,7
comment,Is JMU worth it?,"Something that I don’t think enough students consider when shopping colleges is: can I live here for 4 years? You can get a decent education lots of places, but your time in the classroom is only part of your life during that time. Spending that much time and money somewhere that you’re just going to be miserable and potentially drop out of, or need to transfer from, is not ideal. JMU likes to see applicants with extracurriculars and leadership positions. It’s a very social school, and if you thrive on a community feeling, it’s a great place to be. That being said, I don’t think you have to be specifically Greek to fit in, but I do recommend coming in with an idea of what clubs or organizations might interest you. Even if you don’t stick with them, it’s a great way to meet new people (that aren’t just in your dorm). I’m not saying you need to be a party animal or an extrovert to succeed, but being able to put yourself out there and make connections is an important life skill that I definitely developed and took with me beyond my time at JMU.",2020-07-26 15:16:00,10

JMU also has lots of resources for career and academic planning, counseling, stress relief oasis and art room, great food, and lots of activites. I haven't run into major problems but as other users commented, it is a bit outrageous that a large chunk of the budget goes to athletics and the lack of diversity.

I’ve seen many undergrad students go off to find very successful careers, attend very notable grad schools (Georgetown, Cornell, Yale, Duke, UVA, NYU, etc). Research ain’t exclusive to bio majors. Almost every single professor at JMU does research, which is often not seen at other universities. How can you prove this? Just look up the name of the professors and they’ll more often than not, be participating in a research study or performing a study themselves. If you’re looking for a big name college, and you don’t fit in, you won’t enjoy your time there and won’t get much from it.

Thats pretty bold to say, especially since we have equalizers like the GRE, interviews, and personal statements. Not everything is about the name of the university. And you dont need to specialize in undergrad to get into grad school. Undergraduate programs is to help you diversify your education, hence why a 1/3 of our degree is regarding general education courses. Specialization is mainly for grad schools and especially for PhDs. Im not saying that having a specialization in a major wouldn't help, because certainly it will, but your life experience, GRE, letters of recommendation, and how you present yourself will be more striking to grad admissions than the name of the institution you attend or whether or not you specialized.

That is the reality. Many places don't consider GREs or standardized tests for consideration. Trust me, I've been through this personally. It doesn't sound like you have. I mean, I'm not trying to talk down to you or anything. Coming out of undergrad with a 3.8 average and numerous recommendations in hand ... and it was next to impossible to find a grad school. More than once, I heard: JMU's field of study is too generalized for you to be successful here. I once almost got into Duke, and when I sat down to talk with the people who made the decision, they said everything I did was impressive, the letters, the statement, and so on ... but they just didn't think my undergrad program reflected the rigor they needed. In our college, we have had one person go to Duke in the last 25 years, Syracuse, and maybe one or two NYU, but almost everyone gets stuck in the ""mid-tier"" college range and rarely progress in their field beyond that. And, just for future reference, at least on the arts side (and now having a doctorate myself, but only by switching careers), the order I always have heard from advisers and from my own position is: 1. ""fit"" in field of study 2. ""name"" or background of institution 3. letters of recommendation 4. everything else I have spoken to a few grad admissions panels who said: we don't even look at the GRE.",2020-07-26 16:22:49,-6

comment,"CAA Suspends Fall Sports ~ Dukes Football Team ""To Explore Its Own Schedule""","I understand this point. It’s quite valid and if you are a current student, it certainly does not show a proactive approach for the safety of all. However, try to look at this from a different perspective. I’m not saying it’s right, I’m not saying it is outrightly ignoring or trying to be safe either, but it is another view to objectively look at and understand. 1. JMU Football players and staff are already engaged into summer training on campus. To even be there, it can be assured they are following through with very specific protocol and procedures. If/when exposure happens things will be shut down. Many CAA programs were not even on campus yet. It is definitely easier to “pull the plug” when there isn’t any outlying consequence. 2. JMU athletics is looking at the implications of the current student athletes and knowing the real life consequences financially for some of our current players. JMU this year alone between draftees and UDFA players have higher representation than quite a chunk of FBS schools. Outrightly not giving players a chance to play, especially transfers and seniors who were looking for playing time and exposure, goes against the commitment of those players to the team and their potential to move forward to the next level. 2.5. This has implications beyond this season and can set a negative precedent on JMU football. 3. JMU is looking at an option of an independent schedule if and only if there is a postseason option this fall. If this doesn’t happen, expect the season to be dropped. Just like NDSU, people are skipping out of FBS schools to go to JMU for a chance at a championship rather than a pointless bowl game. 4. I hate to say it, but this is a way to advocate for the current players and hold up a promise to them in giving them a chance to play this season when they didn’t get to make the call to not play. The players didn’t vote for a shutdown. (Enter rant on NCAA continuing to take away money from student athletes.) 5. This is the cynical point: $$$ for JMU is lost without football and a chance to show/argue the chance to play against FBS teams in a “freebie” year shows where JMU is in relation to these teams, building recruitment and or showing that we should in fact “move up.” (I personally love FCS and hope we do not move out.) Are any of these reasons worth players, coaches, and staff getting sick or worse? I personally do not think so, but I believe with us already in summer training camp that they are looking for options before bowing out.",2020-07-18 04:44:09,4

comment,"CAA Suspends Fall Sports ~ Dukes Football Team ""To Explore Its Own Schedule""","I honestly do not know this, but it is an interesting thought. I am sure there is something in NCAA language for student athletes which does cover this. However...(speculation train coming!) I would think that since the college has the ability to determine how the 60+ scholarships (for FCS football) are distributed, that they might be able to also control this. If it is determined by outside sources, there could be doubt in that, since student athletes “are not completing their end of the deal” for their scholarship. That would be a crappy (better words there to use, but I’m trying to be nice) but not unforeseeable dirty way for organizations and institutions to reclaim funds.

Lots of people love to chill there. There is a library of LGBT books and magazines too! (Finding Masculinity, the yellow book, is my favorite.) In the lounge, there’s also a self expression closet where people donate old clothes/bras/binders etc!! It’s a great resource. There are very few gender neutral bathrooms around but they still exist!

comment,Trans Students,"My partner is trans, she came out and started transitioning during her time at JMU. She's had a positive experience. The queer community at JMU is great and she was able to find lots of support. There are a fair number of trans/nonbinary/GNC students at JMU. LGBTQ+ clubs like Madison Equality and QUEST are very active and welcoming. The Lavender Lounge in SSC is a safe hangout space for LGBTQ+ students. I don't know about dorms specifically because I transferred in and never lived in a dorm. But you may be able to reach out online and find another trans person to room with, and most people move off campus after freshman year.",2020-06-18 11:26:13,10
comment,Trans Students,"I’m a cis male, so please take what I say with a grain of salt and I apologize in advance for any ignorance! As far as actual trans students go, I believe I’ve only knowingly had one MTF student in my classes. They were a TA in my class, so I wasn’t particularly close with them. But all the interactions I saw were totally fine/supportive and they were on campus a lot and very involved, so it’s probably safe to assume they had mostly positive experiences (although I’m sure there was a lot of negatives I didn’t see). I know that’s not particularly helpful, and it may depend what college you’re in. I was a psychology student, and I would definitely consider the department to be progressive and supportive (students and teachers). On a more helpful note though, I have a number of friends who were apart of the LGBTQ+ community, including a couple close friends who were really heavily involved in (I think) Madison Equality. I’ve been to the Lavender Lounge in SSC (which another user was talking about) and it’s actually super sweet! I also remembered, as I was looking up a couple things just now, a lot of teachers have stickers on their doors to easily identify themselves as supportive of the LGBTQ+ community. It’s called like a Safe Zone sticker or something like that. I’m not sure how prevalent it is outside of the psychology department, but I wanna say like 90-100% of the teachers in Miller Hall had one up. So yeah, again, maybe not the most informative response but hopefully it helps give you some hope for the way trans students are treated on campus and the kind of LGBTQ+ community that exists (which, from the outside, it seems like there’s a big and strong community, so hopeful that’s actually true and you’re able to get super involved!) I wish you the best here and hope that you have far more positive experiences than negatives! :)",2020-06-18 12:29:39,5

comment,Trans Students,"hey there! i’m a nonbinary student. i transferred here last year and my experience has been well enough. for starters gender inclusive housing is available, and in certain halls (the new jennings hall for instance) bathrooms are self-enclosed so you don’t have to worry about indecent exposure. in the dorming portals there is no way to indicate if someone will be open to rooming with lgbtq+ students, so that for me was trial and error. i eventually DID find a roommate and we get along extraordinarily well, but if you’d rather have a room by yourself or with someone better aligned to your identity- that’s something especially available as of recent. on the application, they changed “gender” back to one’s “sex” for students. which is sort of a backstep imo. there’s effort, but it often can come off as well-intended but poorly executed. there are clubs around: Shades of Pride, QUEST, SOGIE, Madison Equality are all readily available and wonderful. However, in my experiences in my major of study I’m entirely outnumbered by cis people. the campus is primarily white, a little overwhelmingly so, and often not intentionally bigoted, but ignorant. i’ve had issues of transphobia with students (never with professors, though) and i do not feel comfortable outing myself in most circles. simply put from my own experience: the staff try, if they know. the student body themselves are not one i put a lot of faith in. due to my own introversion and discombobulated state (mostly due to the college atmosphere in general) i didn’t spend a lot of time in the aforementioned clubs, but i can tell you the time i spent there was valuable. i believe places like shades of pride and QUEST and all of the above are entirely necessary. they’re open and welcoming and the counseling center has also been warm to lgbtq+ students. through my own wariness of the College Experience, i’ll say tread lightly. there are some incredible staff members dedicating to helping (the associate dean of admissions, joe, comes to mind. he was so helpful for me moving forward, as well as jennifer iwerks who helps run SOGIE.) but you really have to find your niche. i wouldn’t call jmu a diverse community, and certainly not a wildly liberal college overall, but there are people in the right places. you simply have to work to find them. hope this helps. :-)",2020-06-18 13:29:07,3

post,Parking Tips since nobody wants a ticket!,"Parking Tips since nobody wants a ticket! I graduated from JMU two years ago, but I'm pretty sure the parking regulations haven't changed at all, so I figured I'd squash some rumors. This information came directly from a person working in Parking Services, so it should be accurate. 1. Standard parking lot enforcement hours are **7am - 4pm**. Anytime outside of those hours are okay for students to utilize. However, you can **only** use the lots if you have a parking pass of some sort. If you don't have one, you're still at risk for a ticket. 2. Don't believe people when they say that your first ticket will be $0. That's not necessarily true, and definitely not true if you already have a parking pass. I believe they have access to who owns the car, so they'll know that the car belongs to a current student and give you a fine. Don't risk it! 3. Guests can get a ticket, but it's really easy for them to appeal it and get it removed. I think you can go to Parking Services and ask for a guest pass, but don't quote me on that. 4. Parking passes work from up to down. By that I mean that faculty has the ability to park in commuter and resident; commuters have permission to park in resident but NOT faculty. Residents can only park in resident parking. If all the commuter spots are taken, find some resident spots. 5. **You will definitely get a ticket if you are in a metered spot**, regardless of where the meter is located. Either pay up or find another spot. 6. ""Parking Services doesn't work on Sunday."" is a **bold. Face. Lie!** Friends of mine have gotten tickets. Don't trust anyone who says that. 7. Finally, **residents cannot park in parking decks**, regardless of it being after standard enforcement hours! This is super important, because sometimes residents will park there if they're going to different sides of campus. They claim this is a safety reason (you're more likely to get robbed in a parking deck), so you could get a ticket. I hope this information is helpful! I had a car on campus for two and a half years and never got a ticket, so I think I did something right. Enjoy your school year! Go Dukes! P.S. If you have any other tips, add them to this thread!",2019-08-26 20:33:12,33

comment,Parking Tips since nobody wants a ticket!,"Adding to point number 3, if you go to Parking Services with a license and registration for your guest, they will give you a guest pass for a while! I know I brought my car for the last 2 weeks of last semester (registered to my dad, so I was able to do this) and they probably would’ve let me have more time if I had asked!",2019-08-26 22:41:15,7
comment,Parking Tips since nobody wants a ticket!,"Just a few additions: 1. Keep in mind that not all lots are this way. There are two lots, D6 (next to Festival) and V (between Cleveland and Johnston) that are Faculty/Staff 24/7. They aren't indicated as such on the map, but that is the signage and you can get ticketed there at any time as a student. 2. $0 tickets are for your first ""unregistered vehicle"" ticket and your first few tickets for ""improperly displayed permit."" No other ticket type gets a warning. 3. Guest tickets are typically only granted an appeal in extenuating circumstances. It's often easier during orientation and move-in days to get a guest an appeal, but outside of that they're harder to get appealed. 4. Just have this here because I apparently can't skip numbers in this list. 5. Ditto. 6. There is a pamphlet of parking regulations you receive with your parking permit. It says explicitly that parking regulations are enforced 24/7. The myth that weekends are a free-for-all is one of the most commonly spread ones that causes headaches. Also, you or someone you know can park somewhere any number of times without an issues and then get a ticket one day. Nothing changed to make that happen, you just got lucky. 7. This is another very important one, but I want to also say that if you are a commuter in a parking deck, make sure you are **past** the sign that says ""commuter parking starts here"" or whatever. The number of tickets I have seen given from someone that parks just before that sign is very high. A few other things to keep in mind: 1. Pay attention to parking lot signage. 2. Pay extra attention to gameday parking, especially for basketball seasons. Since those games happen during the week they are a frequent source of parking tickets. 3. Parking Services will take pictures for certain tickets. If you're parked over the line, if you're in the grass, a fire lane, in front of a sign that says you can't be there, whatever, there will be a picture showing the appeals committee that you were in the wrong. 4. There is no appealing a ticket for parking in a fire lane. That is a state law and the university cannot grant an appeal for it. 5. Lastly, and the most important: **Don't listen to anyone telling you where you can park other than Parking Services.** The number of tickets issued where people have been told by a coach, by a friend, by another faculty or staff member, whatever, that they can park somewhere is ridiculous. It is not something for which an appeal will be granted. I don't work for Parking, but I have some roles as a staff member that have allowed me to see a lot of the things that cause parking headaches.",2019-08-27 08:10:07,7
comment,Parking Tips since nobody wants a ticket!,"> They claim this is a safety reason (you're more likely to get robbed in a parking deck), so you could get a ticket. I call bullshit on that explanation, because anyone could get robbed in a parking garage. A more likely explanation is that based on the location of these large parking structures, they want the spaces to turn over on a regular basis, and be available for people who are coming in from outside campus. I remember reading back when I was a student that the resident lots were intended primarily for car storage, with the idea that cars kept there would stay in one place for longer periods at a time, since, after all, you're not driving in every day to attend class, and only would move the car if you're going off campus. Thus they don't want cars that won't leave campus every day tying up the garages.",2019-08-28 04:53:03,2

They said in their denial that they would allow a second appeal for the ticket, but only if she first paid the ticket in full. The hell with that, because then they would just deny it again and have our money.

comment,Parking Tips since nobody wants a ticket!,I probably should have explained further: you're more likely to get robbed in a parking deck \*overnight. The parking service worker explained that cars that are left overnight in parking decks are more likely to be broken into than those left overnight in an outside parking lot. The probability of a car with a resident parking pass being left overnight in a parking deck is most likely higher than the probability of a car with a commuter/faculty parking pass being left overnight. So they probably just made the blanket rule that anyone with a resident parking pass isn't allowed. I'm not arguing for or against what this parking service guy told me. It could also just be a coverup for you explanation. Only parking services knows.,2019-08-31 10:30:38,1

The UBO does also send accounts to collections agencies and they will utilize the Virginia Set-Off-Debt program that allows them to have the money taken out of your Virginia tax refund.

There are buses at the end of the street which takes you to Godwin as well or you can walk. * Quiet. Not much of a party scene here since there are also non-students living in the townhouses on the road leading up to the apartments. If you like quiet this is a good place for you. * 4 bed AND 4 bath. Every person gets their own bathroom which is really nice. * Includes a 50"" TV with a roku and fully furnished. * Usually wont have a problem with parking * Close to Walmart and East Campus **Cons:** * You are effectively paying around $460 when you include utilities. You also have to pay for each utility at different times of the month which can be a hassle. * Don't have any amenities, basically paying for the proximity to campus. * Use crate furniture (dorm furniture) for everything. Couches are not comfy and I bought my own office chair because the one they gave was not comfortable at all * Internet provided is really bad **Other Thoughts:** In my personal opinion you can do a lot better for the price you pay at MV. You don't have any amenities or events hosted by the complex but you do get a quiet place right next to campus. We've only had 1 problem so far with a maintenance issue (dryer stopped working and it took them a week to get us a new one after we emailed them days after our maintenance request) but nothing big has happened. Lastly, be wary of the internet. It is provided by Hi Speed Link which is a local company that usually serves people out in the country side, not apartments (correct me if I'm wrong) so don't be surprised if streaming is low quality or you can't load websites. **TL;DR:** Kind of expensive for lack of amenities and bad internet, but great location. 5.5/10",2018-10-02 17:50:02,11

So its easy to miss the bus. The walk to campus is annoying but very do able. &#x200B; &#x200B;",2018-10-04 12:50:53,5
comment,Off Campus Housing Megathread,"Southview Rent: $409/mo for 4 bed/4 bath, $414 if we stay. Current price on the website is $469, I'd wait until they offer bonuses. Included utilities: All (water, electricity, internet, heat, trash), electricity was a special deal. Amenities: Clubhouse/fitness center, some occasional events Other: 3 buses come semi-frequently (13, 14, 19), maybe every 20-30 min in the morning and hour in the afternoon. Lots of resident parking, few visitor parking. Some things may stop working, e.g. the dryer or porch lights, but maintenance usually takes care of it. Only lived here for 1 month so far, so maybe the management office will slack later. Location is on the same strip with Foxhill and Squire Hill, there's more of a party scene down there.",2018-10-03 11:03:03,1

comment,Off Campus Housing Megathread,"**Campus View** **Rent:** ~$450/mo **Included:** Electricity, Water, ""Trash"" (Take trash to dumpster, so I guess that counts?) **Not Included:** Internet (fat RIP), however we just pay about $20 per person to get 400 download/10 upload, and it works just fine for us. **Amenities:** Pool, Gym, Free printing, study areas in the clubhouses, volleyball court, basketball court **Pros:** * Bus Route 15 stops right outside our apartment for those without a car * 4 bed/4 bath, walk in closet. * Always a party not too far away if that's your thing **PRO/CON** - Campus is about a 5-10 minute drive away, 15-20 minutes with traffic, it's never been a problem for me however. **Cons** * Difficult to find parking sometimes from Thursday night to Saturday night because of the parties * Visitor parking is virtually impossible to find from Thurs-Sat * The parties, if it's something you don't like. I would walk outside on a Friday and hear parties all around. * First floor apartment so we had some weird small black beetle problems the first week or so but that seems to have cleared up, now we just have the occasionally house centipide. * Walking to campus is out of the question, unless you want to walk 30 minutes to East Campus",2018-10-07 10:53:48,1

comment,Off Campus Housing Megathread,"Currently live at Southview, the roommates I got places with randomly are drug dealers and after getting staff members to come in and physically see them doing drugs and sending many pictures to the main office they still didn't help me. They basically said ""Sorry if you don't like your roommates then you have to pay a $200 moving fee"" but I don't have the time to move and especially don't have the money so they've left me in the deep end on this one. I can't recommend Southview even if everything else is reasonable.",2018-10-07 23:14:19,2
comment,Off Campus Housing Megathread,"Some more on Southview: (Disclaimer: It’s been a year or so since I lived there, so things may have changed) The internet kind of sucked, especially with 4 people using it. The modem was in my bedroom and even when I was sitting right next to it I’d still struggle to connect, and my other roommates got nothing at times. Also visitor parking can be an issue; there’s not much. The buses are really nice and come frequently, but unless things have changed, there are no direct routes to Walmart/the mall so that was annoying for me since I didn’t have a car (but food lion is just down the hill so it’s not a bad walk if you’re not buying too much). If any repairs needed done, they usually got it fixed super quickly which was really nice. Also: there are a lot of parties there so the weekends are super loud.

comment,Off Campus Housing Megathread,"I pay $510 all in for 4 bed 4 bath in Campus View. We pay $480/month and $30 in water and electric. Overall, I think the place is okay. You could spend less money somewhere equally as nice. Or slightly more money in a much nicer place. We opted for the U-Shaped kitchen because we wanted hardwoods in the living room but there is barley any shelving or counter space. The bedrooms are great, pretty big, queen bed included, walk-in closet, and nice bathroom in each. The main problems we've had is with parking. If you come back late from school or work it's hard to find a space, and guest parking on the weekends is impossible. They assign 1 guest pass per 4 people in 1 apartment and you have to park in the space labeled visitor (which are usually filled) with the guest pass. There are probably 40-50 spots total and sooooo many people living in Campus View. The pool is very small, gym doesn't have much equipment. They reward us for paying rent on time but it is usually by giving you 10% off of a t-shirt or hat at the farmers market??? The drive to east campus is not bad at all- maybe 7 minutes and Reservoir is much better than Port in terms of traffic. I would't necessarily recommend campus view. Save money somewhere else for the same apartment.",2018-10-11 12:25:33,1

You have to do some research as a renter yourself, instead of just signing a contract and living in a generic looking place that’s over priced and over running with stupid frat boys.

The point of this thread was to talk about renting options. That’s what I did. Sorry if I came across the wrong way but that’s not my intention. The best way to look for independent would be through craigslist. Again I’ve never had any extreme issues going this route.,2018-10-05 20:53:07,1

This is such a terrible thing. I'm from Salem VA, and have been watching Alison report since she got to the station. The camera man Adam Ward was a Tech alumna and graduated from Salem High School back in my home town. (27). Alison Pakrer was also News Editor for JMU's nationally recognized newspaper, The Breeze, which has received numerous press awards. (just turned 24). Updates for people just reading about this: * There is a brief frame where you can get a decent glimpse of the man involved in the shootings. Look on /r/All for the two reports. * No known motive, they were reporting on local tourism in the area. * The woman being interviewed was shot in the back and is currently in surgery, hopefully she can recover and give an eye-witness on the man. * CNN tweeted saying they have a license plate and name for the suspected shooter. Governor McAuliffe tweeted: > Heartbroken over **senseless** murders today in Smith Mountain Lake. State Police on scene working w/ local law agencies to capture suspect. Prayers for both Ward and Parker, for their families, their friends, and their loved ones. Prayers even for the people who saw this live. There are videos on /r/News and /r/WTF of the attack.

post,Emergency ride from Lynchburg to Harrisonburg or Lynchburg to Lexington.,"Emergency ride from Lynchburg to Harrisonburg or Lynchburg to Lexington. So I need to find a way to get back home to Harrisonburg. Before I begin the story I’d like to say that I am currently safe in a hotel. I (female) took a MegaBus on Saturday (07/02) from Harrisonburg to Lexington to visit my so called boyfriend who lives in Lynchburg. There is no direct bus that goes from Hburg to Lynchburg so he had to pick me up from Lex to drive me to his house. Sometime this evening he and I got into an argument which led to him taking my belonging outside to the curb and then kicking me out of his house and locking it. I scrambled to get myself a hotel and now I am stranded without a car in Lynchburg until Jul 5 which is when I’m suppose to check out. It is 9PM and he has not reached out to me since the incident and I just want to get home to Harrisonburg at this point and forgot this. I’m willing to pay someone to take me to either Lexington where I can catch a MegaBus or pay someone to take me straight to Harrisonburg. Will show you my JACard, VA ID and hotel receipt and you can do the same on showing IDs. **07/04 UPDATE** 11AM: I have reached out to a contact/friend in the Roanoke/Lex area and it is looking good so far. They are willing to help. Thank you everyone who reached out. I will post another update once I’m safe with this friend and headed home **7PM July 4**: wonderful news, I am home safely in my apt!! Thank you to everyone who extended out a helping hand to a complete stranger. I was very surprised at how many ppl were so willing to help in such an emergency.",2022-07-03 22:10:27,36

post,(WARNING) WHITE SEDAN EGGED ME LAST NIGHT (LOOKING FOR INFO + WARNING),"(WARNING) WHITE SEDAN EGGED ME LAST NIGHT (LOOKING FOR INFO + WARNING) Hello all, I was walking back to east campus from grace street at around 3 am last night when I got egged out of nowhere. Now, I had been drinking so I couldn't get the license plate number but I know that it was a white sedan with tinted windows driving around with atleast two people (the driver couldn't have egged me) at 3am. Also, the person in the back was an overweight white guy (although that doesn't exactly narrow it down at this school lol). If anyone has any info on who it could've been, I would love to go to the police with this information cause I am still fuming. Also, just a quick warning to everyone walking home late at night, even if you are a 6'3"" athletic male like me, you can still get assaulted by some losers, they just couldn't do it with their hands cause they'd know they would lose. P.S.- If you were involved in any way with this, just know that you completely killed my buzz, ruined the rest of my night, and made me lose quite a bit of faith in humanity. You are simply the worst kind of people. UPDATE: I went to JMU PD and put in a police report. Apparently it happened to multiple people last night as this supposed group of losers had nothing better to do than go around egging random people (even egged a girl in the face), everyone involved should truly be ashamed of themselves whether you get caught or not. Hopefully this vehicle didn't pass any cameras on campus. If you did, enjoy your Class 1 misdemeanor charge!",2022-02-27 11:56:56,32

comment,Is there any support for an off-campus housing union?,"As I said in another post. Legit your only option is leaving jmu. They aren’t going to let several thousand kids go online again as it hurts the budget and the kids have no place to live because they all have been evicted. Also it is extremely likely this is the route they take as it is standard practice for any agency. The company wouldn’t fail either as you said. The next class would move in and kids would come back as the rental companies can hold out much longer then the kids can. So what, you get a max of 5k kids to move home while still paying rent? Seems like a shitty deal to me and that they would return back and have to pay massive fees to get housing back. Also….college housing has always been like this. You seriously think someone wouldn’t have tried this if it worked?",2021-04-28 19:46:23,5
comment,Is there any support for an off-campus housing union?,You *voluntarily signed a contract.* You gave them your business.

THIS DOES NOT REFLECT THE SITUATION AT JMU &#x200B; Off the top of my head I can think of over 14 people who have already been exposed but are not yet confirmed cases (many of them are off campus). Some of these cases are being examined in retrospect, therefore if they do have it who knows how many OTHERS they exposed. &#x200B; I also know of professors who have been exposed but are not included anywhere in this data on the dashboard. There's reports coming out of class rooms of sizable percentages of students in classrooms exposed and it is day 2 of class. These are mid to upper tier classes so they people exposed and ""quarantining"" likely live off campus and would not be subject to the dashboard. &#x200B; **KEEP IN MIND, ONLY 31% OF THE 21K JMU STUDENTS LIVE ON CAMPUS, THE DASHBOARD IS THE MINORITY (about 1/3) OF THE POTENTIAL DATA OF STUDENTS ONLY.

comment,"Hey Dukes, make sure that y’all download VDH’s COVID-19 exposure notification app before you head back to Harrisonburg next week!","It's incredibly selfish to think otherwise. There's a lot of ""but I really wanna do x"" and ""I'll take my chances"" going around these days. I'm glad they can take the risk. Others aren't so fortunate. Their recklessness will hurt others. There's a a reason we're doing such a poor job at containing the virus compared to other countries. It's because people with this mentality are allowed to run around and do whatever they want. Maybe school, parties, and tHe eCoNoMy aren't what's important right now. Maybe the more we try to brute-force things back to normal, the more damage we do and the longer it will take for things to reach that level of normalcy. EDIT: On another note, I also find it ridiculous that now is the time we start taking seriously the opinions of college kids. Most people on this sub can't even buy their own alcohol. Are they really the authorities to decide if an organization with 20,000+ people from all over the country should reopen?",2020-08-10 21:36:12,14

comment,Shots fired?,"HPD released a statement on Facebook: HPD Investigating Shooting Devon Lane Shooting HARRISONBURG, Va. – At approximately 1:00 am this morning, officers with the Harrisonburg Police Department (HPD) and James Madison University Police Department (JMU) responded to the 1400 block of Devon Lane after hearing gun shots in the area. Officers were then approached by a male victim who had suffered a gunshot injury to his lower leg. The male victim was transported by the Harrisonburg Rescue Squad to Sentara RMH Medical Center with non-life threating injuries. The suspect fled the area on foot immediately after the incident. A perimeter was established and HPD K-9 attempted to track the suspect with negative results. Police were able to locate evidence related to the incident on the scene. The incident is believed to be related to a disagreement that at a party just prior to the shooting. HPD is seeking input from anyone with information about this incident or the identity of suspect. Suspect is described as a black male wearing a black shirt and white washed jeans. This is believed to be an isolated incident, and it is not believed there is any risk to the public at this time. HPD encourages anyone with information regarding this incident to contact the Major Crimes Unit by calling (540) 437-2650. Those who have information and wish to remain anonymous can contact Crime Solvers at (540) 574-5050 or by texting “HPD” plus their tip to CRIMES (274637).",2019-09-21 11:40:32,31

post,Has anyone accessed the underground tunnels? How?,"Has anyone accessed the underground tunnels? How? This may have been discussed on this sub already, but I'm really curious as to how to get into the tunnels that run underneath the quad. Has anyone gone down there and/or known someone who has?",2013-10-22 15:10:49,34
comment,Has anyone accessed the underground tunnels? How?,"I've accessed the tunnels many many times. Our friends did it a couple different ways. 1) Get lucky. Check the doors leading to them that are exposed on the outside of buildings. If someone has already gotten in and left using it, it will be unlocked. 2) Downstairs of Harrison Hall. The downstairs of harrison (with the vending machine oasis), has a big hallway that stretches either left and right. The double doors at the end of that hallway (on the quad side of course) will lead you to the tunnels. I've seen some really bad-ass sorority girls bust through that thing with a screwdriver and a hammer (unscrewing the guard in the middle that protects the door from a credit card) and once you get through that first double door, you have another one to get through. Once you get through that double door, you are in the tunnels. (the second double door is the one you actually unscrew stuff on) 3) The vents on the quad lead to the tunnels. Ive seen many of these vents have the screws welded on, but one of the vents didn't if I recall. They may have fixed this, as it was 3 yrs ago....but I would check (one of the vents below ashby hall) Oh...and use the search function. http://www.reddit.com/r/jmu/search?q=tunnel&restrict_sr=on",2013-10-22 21:19:54,12

comment,Has anyone accessed the underground tunnels? How?,There are several entrances on the left side (when looking at main st) in between the buildings. They are usually deadbolted and the door handle is locked as well. We got lucky and the deadbolt was unlocked and we were able to pry the door open to disengage the lock on the handle. My advice is to buy a $3 lockpick set online and watch some how-to videos and practice on some of your own locks. This way you won't cause any damage. Also you can get in a decent amount of trouble for doing this so it's at your own risk. Also it's really not that cool. But the experience is.,2013-10-22 20:43:05,2
comment,Has anyone accessed the underground tunnels? How?,Don't go through Ashby the building- we got into the subbasement once when it was unlocked and literally took a door off the hinges in order to go in the direction of the quad...it ended in a bricked up wall that most likely used to be tunnel access.

comment,Rant,"Might be an unpopular opinion, but I can’t blame any students for selling them. Sure, they’re corny, but it’s an opportunity for easy money people are bound to exploit.

comment,Rant,"I went to college many years ago, at a much bigger football school than JMU, and was a huge fan. But I would sell tickets to big games sometimes, because I really needed the money.

comment,Rant,What typically happens is only the barcode is transfered. What this means is the ticket still belongs to the student it was issued to but someone else is using the ticket. There was nothing stopping someone from selling the same ticket multiple times. The only person who can use the ticket is the first person who presents the barcode to be scanned.,2023-11-12 15:44:57,3
comment,Rant,At JMU they don't have enough student tickets for the football games for all of the students yet they charge ~~$4724~~ $2362 a year to each student in athletics fees. I might agree with you if every student could get a ticket. Problem is at JMU not all the students who want a ticket can get a ticket. At JMU the action of selling a student ticket means another student cannot get that ticket. **EDIT:** Corrected the athletics fees. The university rates breakdown used to be per semester and not year. The rates breakdown is now per year.,2023-11-12 10:36:13,19

comment,JMU to keep same COVID protocols for spring semester,i think part of why they aren’t requiring boosters is because everyone got their vaccine at different times so it would be really difficult to require boosters at this point since some people wouldn’t be eligible yet. hopefully they’ll be required eventually but at this point i think it would be difficult for the school to keep track of that.,2021-12-30 11:26:37,7

Hopefully, Omicron being milder - especially if vaccinated and if boosted - means we're close to the end of the pandemic.

I do think some hybrid format is likely to be announced sometime in September because cases and deaths are soaring again. Also, it depends on JMU's testing situation. They didn't enforce the entry testing, and that makes me doubt they will enforce the weekly testing. Even if they did, it would not give an accurate picture of the spread at JMU because even vaccinated people will be spreading it with little to no symptoms. The mask mandate will 100% be in place for the entire semester as well.

comment,What do you think are the chances that we’ll get shut down/move to online due to an outbreak of the new variant?,"They have to have permission to do so. There are a number of hurdles to taking a class online that most people don't consider. When departments set up classes for the semester, many things have to be taken into account as they create those schedules, not the least of which being facilities use. So taking a class online after it has been set up requires changes to that and so requires administrative approvals. In addition, requesting the class be online from the start may also require approval. When fall 2020 was first being planned, which keep in mind was happening before anything was really looking serious to most people, several professors were trying to get approval for online courses for various reasons and were having a hard time of it.

comment,Delta Dawn at JMU?,"It’s been stated on a couple other r/JMU posts but no one seems to wanna listen, but I had a meeting with a JMU faculty member who is part of the decision making process for covid protocol and vaccinations. What that individual told me and a friend of mine was that at the time of the meeting (two days prior to the deadline) there were only 80 forms turned in. Based off of the people I know who also signed the form, there is a very high likelihood that not even 150 people on JMU’s campus will not be vaccinated. That’s 3/4 of a percent. What people ALSO seem to be ignoring us that there is still weekly testing for unvaccinated students. So if there is a worry that there will be an outbreak among the unvaccinated, the other 99.25% of students have literally nothing to worry about.",2021-08-01 18:28:46,15

post,COVID Testing,"COVID Testing Hi there. I'm a sophomore for context. I was recently tested by the school for COVID 19 and I received my lab results this morning as negative. I entirely believe because I only had a fever and sore throat for all of two days and thought it would be safe to get tested, however, I have been fever and sore throat free for three days. My PA sent me my results and lab report and said that I had difficulty breathing, fatigue, and loss of taste and smell. NOT. TRUE. And now she tells me I ""MUST"" quarantine with my roommate(no beds left) till the ninth. ""false negative"" is what she told me, I would believe this but since she lied about my symptoms and said I came back negative I sent a lengthy email to the administration calling them on their bullshit about sending us back(money grab), handling of COVID(cautious optimism), and transitioning to online with five days' notice. Mixed with the UHC completely misrepresenting my symptoms I have a serious lack of faith in President Alger, the UHC, and the administration. Just venting. Go dukes",2020-09-04 09:22:51,33
comment,COVID Testing,"hey i hear you about them not documenting your symptoms right, that is weird and frustrating. since i'm in health care here are just two thoughts I also had: 1) i still think you should quarantine. you've got at least a couple symptoms that *could* be COVID and not only are tests faulty but you also could have been tested at the wrong time in the illness to have enough virus show up, etc... there are lots of holes in the system and bottom line is that we're in a pandemic and need to always err on the side of caution (which is why we never should have gone in-person to begin with). 2) in defense of the medical staff who didn't do their job right... the UHC has been getting destroyed with a workload that is just too big of a burden for their resources. they were put in a shitty spot and even though I never saw their operations in the past weeks I can easily believe that everyone there has been stressed to the gills and could easily make a mistake. &#x200B; bottom line is that you're in a shitty position, the school blew it, and honestly someone like Alger should quarantine in a dorm with a bunch of sick kids for a few weeks while trying to do online schoolwork and wait in long lines at packed dining halls and have to move in and move out within 2 weeks... just to see how it feels 🤣",2020-09-04 15:48:20,14

post,"An Analysis of ""A temporary transition to online learning""","An Analysis of ""A temporary transition to online learning"" TL;DR - We all expected this. Oh, and they’re doing some sneaky stuff to avoid refunding or reducing tuition and fees. A few things stuck out to me after reading and reviewing the administration’s latest email. I’ll discuss them here. All quotes are directly from the recent emails from JMU President Johnathan Alger and the Office of the President. First the good stuff: “*In the days since students have been back on campus, we have observed their vibrancy, excitement to engage with their faculty, and large-scale adherence to COVID-19 rules and guidance.*” I like that the University isn’t immediately trying to shift the blame onto the student body. Yes, some students were partying, and yes, the parties were at least partially responsible for the boom in cases, there are a few things to consider. First, both the amount of partying and number of JMU students attending parties is unknown and frankly unknowable, given that a sizable percentage of parties occured off campus. Second, while partying was a factor in the increased number of cases, it is unknown how significant of a factor it was, especially when compared to other factors like the overcrowding of classrooms and ESPECIALLY the overcrowding of dining halls. … and that’s all the good stuff. Let’s continue. “*Protecting the health of our Harrisonburg and Rockingham County community—including students, faculty, staff—is our top priority, and we need to act swiftly to stop the spread as best we can.*” I think we can all agree that if health and safety was JMU’s number one priority, we would not have returned to campus in the first place. What’s likely is that they needed to bring students back to campus, at least for a short while, in order to justify collecting full tuition, as well as charging for meal plans, housing costs, parking passes, etc. Let’s continue. “*After consultation with the Virginia Department of Health, James Madison University will transition to primarily online learning, with some hybrid instruction for accreditation and licensure requirements, graduate research, and specialized upper-class courses requiring equipment and space, through the month of September.*” I take back what I said about there only being one good piece of good stuff in this email. Some programs can only exist on campus, and this seems to be a fair accommodation for the minority of students who are involved in licensing programs, grad. Research, and labs, which is what I assume they are referring to in that last section. “*Additionally, in an effort to reduce the number of people on campus, residents will be asked to return home by Sept. 7 unless they seek an exemption to stay.*” This is a little more of a mixed bag. While sending students home does make things safer for the people of Harrisonburg and Rockingham County, it also means that you’re sending potentially 500+ infected students, as well as any students who have been in contact with them, back home to spread the disease. JMU really doesn’t have an out here. The only thing I can think of would be to quarantine everyone in their dorm rooms for two weeks, but that would be incredibly difficult to enforce, would likely anger parents and students who just want to get out as soon as possible, and could possibly make the situation worse - COVID may spread faster in the dorms than anywhere else. If you’ll allow me to skip ahead, there is a passage later down in the email that is relevant to this. “*To protect the health and safety of the communities to which students might be returning, students who have been advised to isolate or quarantine should finish out their prescribed time before leaving Harrisonburg. Additionally, as a precaution, students should plan to quarantine for two weeks upon arriving at their destination.*” Ultimately, JMU has put themselves between a rock and a hard place. By bringing students back and incubating so many cases, all they can really do now is keep a few people here, and give the rest this recommendation. Now. **HERE’S WHERE THINGS START GETTING SUS.** “*Over the next month, university officials will carefully monitor health trends and other developments, and will be in touch with the campus community by Sept. 25 regarding the possibility of returning to in-person instruction on or after October 5.*” The odds of us returning after four weeks are slim to none. It would be one thing if cases were going down, but the number of cases is rising not just in Virginia, but across the entire United States. **AND HERE’S THE KICKER.** “*While courses will move primarily online during this four-week period, the university will remain open, and continue to offer on-campus amenities, such as dining, health and wellness services. Decisions about refunds have not yet been made, but we will communicate with students and families as soon as possible on that topic.*” JMU is likely doing this in an attempt to keep as much of the money as they can. They will probably cite the cost of maintaining these amenities as the main reason they cannot reduce or refund tuition and fees, at least for a while. I’d wager that these costs are going to be even higher too, because they have to work even harder to make sure everything is conducted in a safe manner. “*All along, we understood that we might need to transition to online learning at any moment if circumstances required.*” Proof that all of this was premeditated. “*Also, the university has recently made significant investments in the technological infrastructure needed to support those efforts, such as acquiring a license with Zoom, a leading virtual meeting tool.*” These investments are another expense JMU can cite as a reason they need to keep the money. I know many professors are using other online tools in addition to Zoom, such as Piazza, Slack, WebEx, Gradescope, labArchives, and many more. “*In the meantime, our decisions will continue to be guided by public health and educational considerations at every turn. Working together in the finest spirit of JMU, I believe that Dukes can rise to meet this significant challenge.* *Warm regards,* *Jonathan R. Alger* *President, James Madison University*” At least they ended with something better than “cautious optimism” and “... in any given day, the number of new positive cases is not a singularly determinant factor in our decision making...” Still, in my opinion this response does not make up for bringing us on campus in the first place.",2020-09-01 20:35:29,30
comment,"An Analysis of ""A temporary transition to online learning""","The next JMU Board of Visitors meeting is September 18 (https://www.jmu.edu/visitors/meetings/minutes/2020/). I think it's safe to say that most decisions, in regards to refunds, will be made at that time",2020-09-01 21:31:03,8
comment,"An Analysis of ""A temporary transition to online learning""","I posted this in another thread but I think it’s kinda important to consider. I’m sure this will be downvoted, but people partying is a big part of the reason why we are going online. Is jmu responsible for bring us back and not testing-absolutely yes. However, everyone at jmu is 18+. They know right from wrong and they chose to party knowing the consequences. Their actions are punishing the people who took this seriously from the start. Jmu cant hold our hands to ensure that we follow all the rules/cdc guidelines. The students need to also be responsible and do their part, and they didn’t. Look at all the frats and sororities shut down rn. Is jmu ultimately responsible-absolutely. But so are the students who chose to party.

post,Not a Party Person,"Not a Party Person I have yet to find one person who doesn't like JMU. And, everyone seems really happy and adjusted as adults, which I have not seen from other schools like UVA or W&M. It's actually kind of crazy. While I have not been accepted yet, I feel that my chances are pretty good. However, my one theory to why everyone seems so happy, is that they are collectively similar people. JMU definitely has a reputation for being a party school and I have yet to attend one party. I'd say yes to going to a party but I'd get pretty annoyed at loud parties every weekend. I'm a pretty quiet person who likes to watch *Poldark* and read (which is not the vibe I think JMU gives off).

comment,Not a Party Person,"I went out to parties occasionally, but I was definitely not an every weekend sort of person. I still had a great time despite that and think JMU was a great fit for me anyway. As others have posted, the party scene is there for those who enjoy it, but there are plenty who enjoy other activities on the weekends. By my senior year, I was pretty much only going to parties that friends threw or hosting small shindigs or movie nights ourselves. While I had friends who were every weekend partiers, I had a bunch of friends who liked the more low-key hangouts or other adventures. JMU draws a wide variety of people with a wide variety of interests. I guarantee you can find many people who will share your interests, and absolutely people who will watch Poldark with you. :)",2019-02-08 16:13:49,5

I have 4 really good friends right now who have also never partied and we just watch shows or play games and it’s awesome.

Try to find a roommate through their system that doesn’t party and don’t be afraid to say no to people.

comment,Not a Party Person,"Lmao, that wasn't your point. Read your original post. A prospective student is asking about the culture and you imply that they should consider other schools because of the party reputation. You keep moving the goalposts in all the discussions you're having here, like when people point out the party scene is actually more controlled nowadays than pre-disaster spring fest. (Also, stop immediately downvoting all the replies you're getting, it's obvious and childish.) I know for a fact that my degree from JMU helped me get my first job out of college back in 13. The manager's daughter was going there and he knew it was a good school, her first choice was UVA but that's a lot of JMU students. And I'm sure he knew what kind of school Radford is too. A degree is a degree generally but some are still worth more. The farther out from graduation the less it matters what school you went to. I'd happily encourage any prospective students to come to JMU if they can't quite get in UVA or W&M. I chose it over VT because of my major and the general atmosphere on campus. It's a good school. You basically said that it's not, because employers think it's a party school. That's where people are disagreeing with you. Your original point was the opposite of arguing ""a degree is a degree"", it said a JMU degree is worth something less than some other vague degree. Get it?

comment,Not a Party Person,"Yes, I did say you were moving the goalposts and I gave multiple examples why, and here you are ignoring that part of my post and most of the rest or don't understand. Care to explain exactly what goalposts I moved? I wasn't the guy who brought up ""a degree is a degree"" in the first place. All I said was that it's partially true, yes. Do you think you ""got me"" there somehow for partly agreeing with that statement generally? It follows from what I said that a degree from JMU is worth some amount more than a Radford one, and some amount less than a UVA one for example. I'm arguing JMU doesn't have a shit reputation, that's all. You're acting like you're the one who gets to decide the schools reputation. I'd encourage you to do more research online of school rankings if you're so disheartened about your alma mater. Maybe go check out a job fair in Showker where big employers are literally throwing jobs at students. I work in consulting in the DC metro area. Not sure what the employment situation in Hburg is but I can imagine. Forgive me if I somehow doubt your read on the pulse of statewide employers opinions of the school, lol. I can tell you firsthand that companies like Booz, KPMG, etc were more than happy to snap up a ton of people I graduated with at JMU, and that was only a few years after the fucking riot. And 5 years later, a few jobs and and plenty of interviews later my degree from JMU has been nothing but a strength in interviews. What about you, have you felt opposite in your interviews post graduation? Your evidence is vague, anecdotal ""I work with a lot of employers TRUST ME"". My evidence is anecdotal too. And thats fine, we can have different opinions there. But in a thread made by a prospective student I'm not going to let your opinion be the only one. Have a good one.",2019-02-08 15:47:39,2

comment,I got in!,"Not a transfer, but I can answer your other questions. On-campus and off-campus have their ups and downs. Living on-campus is less stress. Cleaning people take care of the bathrooms and lounges, you don't have to travel far for classes, there's lots of people to meet, and you don't have to worry about paying for rent/utilities and buying groceries/preparing meals. However, once you go off campus, you won't want to go back. It's cheaper, you get your own room and bathroom (or at least one with a lock), and you truly are in charge of everything. You also don't have to answer to any RA's or deal with any forced community participation. The only person you answer to is yourself. However, the corporations that own the college apartments are notoriously annoying. They know we're basically giant kids who haven't had much time to adult, to they push us around, trying to be part-landlord and part-parent. For example, my apartment decided to do an inspection over spring break (something they do in the dorms). The kicker was that they didn't notify us until *after* we left. That shit doesn't fly in normal apartments. They also like to nickel and dime you for damanges after you move out, so make sure to take good care of your place, note EVERY sign of damage on move-in, and take pictures. It's a toss-up. If you want to meet people without much effort and pay a little extra for conveniences, live on-campus. If you're willing to put up with annoying landlords, commute to campus, and manage everything yourself, feel free to enjoy the freedoms of off-campus living. Just make sure you get involved with activities on-campus so you meet people. As far as neuroscience goes, I don't believe we have a major in it. You major in biology and specialize in neuro. Then you ideally go on to grad school and find more specific programs from there. Our bio program is pretty good from what I here, so I think you'll enjoy yourself.",2018-04-06 10:16:21,5

comment,I got in!,"It seems like everyone in here says live on campus as a transfer but nobody actually has. When I transferred I was told by everyone to not live on campus as you don't get the same type of environment as Freshman dorms. Everyone in the Sophomore dorms already has their friend groups and are much less inclined to go out of their way to make friends. This is what I was told at least but it makes complete sense to me. Even though I never lived on campus I still knew it inside and out. You don't have to live there to get familiar with it, that will come with time regardless. At the end of the day it's up to you, but I personally feel on campus life is like living with training wheels. You have people cleaning up after you, you can't really make your own food, you have limited space if a friend from out of town wants to visit, etc. If you've never lived away from home before it may ease the transition but it depends on your mentality and personality.",2018-04-10 17:47:01,3

I found some really great roommates and made friends pretty easily and I feel like the amount of freedom I had living off campus more than made up for whatever I may have missed not living in a dorm. I do regret not going to orientation and more on campus activities though, so I’d say if you choose off campus definitely make those a priority esp when you first get there. Plus, it’s always an easy win for Never Have I Ever to say “never have I have lived in a dorm,” since all incoming freshmen are required to ;) Congrats, and have all the fun!!",2018-04-06 12:27:24,2

comment,I got in!,"I came in as a freshman, so I can’t speak to the transfer experience personally, but I would strongly recommend living on campus if you graduated HS only last year. All in all, living off campus is way more fun, but *only if you’re living with friends.* Yes, there is a chance you could random into great roommates off campus, but you are much less likely to recover from randoming into people you don’t jive with if you go off campus. I lived on campus freshman and sophomore year in 2008-2009, and am still friends with many people from my freshman dorm. Nevertheless, osme of our group randomed into the sophomore dorms on campus, and they are also super close friends. Living off campus is definitely way more fun with people you already know and are close with. Take the year to find your cohort on campus, then move off with them later on imo.",2018-04-05 21:13:55,1

comment,Meal plan changes invoke rage,"They make so much money off of meal plans already and it’s scummy that they’re hoping students don’t use them. I always had a few spare punches at the end of the week and it was nice to use them all to stock up on snacks. There’s no reason this limitation should exist. If you’re going to require freshmen to buy an expensive meal plan, then they should at least have the freedom to spend as many punches as they want on a given day.

Tin foil hat: Alger used his position at JMU to build the school with blank checks he was not in a position to cash. But the school saw massive success and increased registration, so they left it alone. Because of the recent success, he may have leveraged this success to get the job with American University. In his wake, there has to be massive amounts of debt that the successor will have to deal with. I am unsure of donations the school has received, or any other financial information.

Their actions are punishing the people who took this seriously from the start. Jmu cant hold our hands to ensure that we follow all the rules/cdc guidelines. The students need to also be responsible and do their part, and they didn’t. Look at all the frats and sororities shut down rn. Is jmu ultimately responsible-absolutely.

post,Jersey drivers..,"Jersey drivers.. Thursday afternoon, driving North on 81, I'm in the left lane about to pass a truck in the right lane. Then on my right a car is coming up fast and squeeze itself in between the small space between me and the car in front of me. Nothing unusual. Happens all the time. But now I can clearly see the JMU sticker and the Jersey plates :-) Now, I think that the driver in front of the Jersey car might be getting a little annoyed by her coming up that close, so he slows down a little and doesn't pass the truck, and suddenly the Jersey driver sees an opportunity to follow the truck in the right lane and sneak around. However, then the car in front of me decides to speed up again and this time I follow closely behind and so does the car behind me, and suddenly she is a couple of cars behind.. For the next thirty miles we can see her weaving in and out behind us, but never catching up. At some point I suspected that the car behind me was playing games with her. Before I exit on 66, she is right behind me again. Too close behind me. So as a final gesture I decide to wash my windows for a minute or two, forcing her to turn on her wipers too. She probably didn't get the message, but it was worth a try, and it made my wife giggle. I'll be the first to go a little faster - whenever possible, but if there is fairly dense traffic, it is pretty pointless. Think about it. If there is a car in front of you, then, roughly speaking, 1 second later, you will be in his position, and IF you manage to pass him, you will have cut of 1 second of your journey.",2020-02-23 12:34:56,34

My only beef is with the ones that try to get ahead in dense traffic, when there is absolutely nothing to gain.

I walked away and continued with my browsing, and I heard him chuckle as I walked off. When went to leaving I saw him trying to walk out the doors with like fifteen condoms in his hands without showing his JACard. The girl at the counter was very nice about it and professional, and was like “Sir, you need to show your JACard for those first.” At first he kept pretending to be tired and not hear her, but eventually turned back around and brought them to the counter. When she took one of the condoms and started scanning it multiple times, he stopped her and told her to scan them each individually “to prevent any electrical infetterence,” and then turned around and winked at me. I don’t even think that’s a word. After she scanned each condom put them in a bag and started to ask for his JACard, he kept interrupting her by yawning really loudly.",2021-09-06 16:24:52,30

Employers have already started to require the vaccine as a condition of employment or else lose your job or get tested regularly for Covid.

Also all the companies that have produced vaccines are shady as fuck. Downvote me, but I’ve thought about this. A lot. Not getting vaccinated was a hard choice, but I feel like it’s the right one for me after lots of deliberation. The second that legitimate studies emerge showing all side effects for all age groups and sexes as well as long term effects of the vaccine and I’m comfortable with that data, I’ll take it.

comment,"Students who are not yet vaccinated, why not?","Vaccinations have never been this controversial. You know none of the long-term effects of covid. It could do something like shingles like chicken pox does. Vaccinations are only controversial because it is political. Thats it. You probably see talking heads screaming about it and believe them like those hypocrites aren’t vaccinated. You know what the **potential** side-effects of ibuprofen are? Internal bleeding, tinnitus, difficulty breathing, major heart rate changes. Doesn’t mean you don’t take that right? 🤡 Edit: Here is the list published by the [cdc](https://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/2019-ncov/vaccines/expect/after.html) and here is the one published by [mayo](https://www.mayoclinic.org/coronavirus-covid-19/vaccine-side-effects). Crazy how they don’t have any of the side-effects you listed, because they are **extreme outliers**. Since they occur in such small amounts, you are more likely to experience to experience a bad covid reaction than any of those, so much more-so in fact that it should be a non-conversation. Also, it is possible to get a lasting immunity, but at what cost? You will likely be asymptomatic since you are healthy, so you won’t know. Even if you aren’t you won’t know for a few days. You will spread it to your friends. They will spread it to their friends. Not everyone can get a vaccine, a lot of people are immunocompromised. I am lucky I’m not, because chucklefucks like you are the reason they can’t come back to school safely, or if they do and get it from an idiot like you they have a much higher likelihood of severe reactions and death.

comment,"Students who are not yet vaccinated, why not?","Thanks for sharing your concerns. I’m not going to downvote you or anything like that. I appreciate discussions and while I might not share the same views, I respect people’s right to choice. It seems like you’ve done some research, which is great. When all of this started happening, I spoke to someone I trusted who works on vaccine development, my brother. As my husband and I were thinking about starting a family, I was nervous about what effects the vaccine could have on an unborn child. And if I was going to get the truth from anyone, it would be from family. He explained that most vaccines are 90% the same. They are all made up of the same components. He compared it to making a sandwich. You always have the bread, the lettuce, the tomato. The only thing that changes is the protein. With vaccines, the only thing that changes is what you’re fighting. So In this case, covid. When I asked about the unknown side effects, he explained that while they had just started large scale studies at the time (this was early on), we could actually use the side effects of other vaccines as indicators because the makeup of the vaccines is so similar. As more and more studies come out, we’re finding that he is, and was, correct. The side effects of the covid vaccine are in line with other vaccines the population en masse has already received. My concern with your statement is when you mentioned that the symptoms of covid mimic a cold, and you would get over it. In some cases, that’s correct. I’m others the symptoms are much worse, even for someone young, fit and healthy like yourself. During my clinical rotations for physical therapy, I started seeing patients post-covid who were coming in for rehab. And these were not old, obese people. In one instance in particular, I had a 28 year old male, super healthy, who caught covid and was hospitalized for several weeks. When he came to see me, he was in a wheelchair. His muscles atrophied so bad that he had to retrain how to walk. His lungs had been so badly damaged that he was gasping for air after 5 bicep curls with 1 pound weights. This may be an extreme case. But it is no more extreme than the side effects that concern you in regards to getting vaccinated. Additionally, and of real concern to me, is that anyone who has had covid is now considered to have a “pre-existing condition” because of its long term effects. I understand your hesitations about the vaccine. But it seems that NOT getting vaccinated poses a much greater risk than getting vaccinated.",2021-08-10 17:18:18,5

Thank you, it’s nice to see that there are a handful of thoughtful rational people who may understand that simple truth of: “they might not agree with me, but I respect their choice”.",2021-08-10 19:29:41,4
comment,"Students who are not yet vaccinated, why not?","These vaccines have been studied extensively. Millions of people all over the world have gotten them. They are extremely safe and effective Not to mention if you get any side effects, it would be in the days first after getting the shot not like 5-10 years later. You’re body reacts to the vaccine when you get it",2021-08-10 13:41:36,8

comment,"Students who are not yet vaccinated, why not?","Of course. Like you said, one side screaming at the other that they’re wrong doesn’t change anyone’s opinion. Mostly all vaccines can cause the common nausea, fainting etc, but I’ve listed some of the most popular vaccines, ones that are usually required by public schools and/or universities. The tdap vaccine can cause long term seizures and coma. The flu shot can cause guillian-barre syndrome and may cause seizures if taken with the tdap shot. The MMR vaccine (mumps, measles and rubella) and varicella vaccine (chicken pox) can also cause seizures, pneumonia and swelling or the brain and spinal cord. But these are extreme side effects. Like the ones you’ve listed for covid. But if you look at the rates of occurrence for these side effects, they are very very rare. For example, there were 1249 cases of heart inflammation reported related to the Covid vaccine, both Myo- and pericarditis. This was after 348,000,000 shots were delivered. Those numbers are as of july 31st. There were 143 cases of GBS identified out of 13,000,000 j&j shots. For comparisons sake, think about all the women you know. The majority of them are on some sort of birth control. A very rare side effect of birth control is blood clot or stroke. But that only occurs in <1% of those using the medication, which is actually an exponentially higher rate of risk than any of the covid vaccine side effects. But yet, millions of people choose that risk. I’m hoping some of these numbers will help you feel a little more at ease with the vaccine. Ultimately, I would love for you to get it. I have an immune-compromised family member who is unable to, and while we’re keeping her out of the Public as much as possible, weve had a couple of close calls. My brother works for Merck, btw.",2021-08-10 18:38:30,1
comment,"Students who are not yet vaccinated, why not?","As you just said: you don’t know anything about mRNA vaccines So you should trust the people who do. I don’t know how my car works but I’m able to trust the experts how created it even though there are potentially severe side effects (e.g. getting in a car crash). It’s not possible for us to understand everything around us, so we have to trust that the experts in these fields are able to do their job well which for all intents and purposes, they have so far.",2021-08-10 14:10:40,5
comment,"Students who are not yet vaccinated, why not?","I had that hesitation initially, but the more I read, the less it concerned me. mRNA vaccines have perhaps been around and well studied for longer than you may believe. Certainly more than I believed at first. Use of therapeutic mRNA has existed prior to COVID vaccines, with success. For example, consider this 2009 article that discusses the use of mRNA: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19417017/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/19417017/) or this 2013 discussion of advances in mRNA vaccines: [https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24138818/](https://pubmed.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/24138818/) And I guess my point here would be to evaluate the peer-reviewed literature yourself, rather than through any filter. The people most capable of reviewing that literature for you, and communicating it to you, are MDs. I don't know of any (and I have quite a few friends in the field) that suggest that waiting on the vaccine is wise, but if you don't trust them, please take the time to evaluate yourself. &#x200B; Two other quick points: 1) Two of my best friends in the world work at Merck (who doesn't make the vaccine - so no ""dog in the fight"") as chemical engineers. According to them, the real-world use of the vaccines completely swamps the testing that would be done in a standard vaccine trial, so you have more data for the COVID vaccine that many other standard vaccines. 2) If none of this convinces you, the J&J vaccine is not an mRNA vaccine, it uses a traditional delivery platform. &#x200B; Just my $.02.",2021-08-10 14:26:48,5
comment,"Students who are not yet vaccinated, why not?","Yes, many side effects do go away in 5-10 days.

I’ve been vaccinated before, I think I got a booster for Tetanus (not sure, it was a few years ago) and I passed out when I got home. That was fine, a bit of an extreme reaction, but I was fine.

comment,"Students who are not yet vaccinated, why not?","Luckily for me, I don’t really care much what you think of me. Call me crazy, call me whatever.

But this virus has a 0.002% mortality rate for my age group, and 78% of those people are obese or have a comorbity. I’m not ‘vaccine bullied’, or at least I don’t think I am. Idk what the term means. And again, calling me a stupid little shit won’t make me say “wow, that guy is right! Maybe I am a stupid, clown piece of human trash that should just kill myself if I don’t get a shot!” People like you cause the issue for others that don’t think like me.

comment,"Students who are not yet vaccinated, why not?","Thanks for being one of the few to speak to me like an adult and have an actual back-and-forth about this, it’s a kindness that didn’t go unnoticed and some other who responded didn’t do the same. And I had no idea that the mRNA vaccines had been researched for that long. My understanding was that it was something that had been an idea for a while but was pushed HEAVILY when covid came out, and a rushed, unfinished product was the result, hence my inquiry into side effects of such a thing. And yes, the J&J being a traditional vaccines does change my mind a bit, although the recalls and warnings that are out for it are concerning to me. Like I’ve maintained, I’m not antivax. I’m pro-choice/temporarily anti-covid vaccine. I will seriously consider getting it. Honestly? It probably won’t be soon, but I will seriously look into it with more thought. I spent so much time digging for adverse effects and other such events, I didn’t spend much time looking at the history of the actual mRNA technology itself. I’m still very hesitant because the side effects are still very real and a huge concern of mine, but I appreciate the information that you’ve given me.",2021-08-10 14:36:07,4

post,Any Advice on How to Salvage My Social Life?,"Any Advice on How to Salvage My Social Life? I’m a senior here at JMU, set to graduate in May, and the realization that I won’t be here much longer has started to sink in. I’ve spent some time thinking about my experiences, particularly from a social perspective, and honestly I feel like I’ve squandered it. I’m not really involved in any clubs/organizations these days. Anything I was involved in my freshman/sophomore year I’ve let fall by the wayside. Honestly, ever since I moved off campus last year, I’ve been a shut in. I didn’t have a car at the time, so I used that as an excuse, but I do have one now. I did go out to a handful of parties, but I’m starting to regret not going to more. I especially miss the times when there used to be 10-20 of us drinking, listening to music, and overall just having a good time. Unfortunately, to that end I’d say I’ve only made a lot of surface level “friends”. Friends from classes and stuff where we’ll say hi if we see each other, but none of them have really developed into being close friends that hang out regularly. Even my roommate and I exist on totally different schedules so we barely talk. I really don’t want to continue through my senior year like this. Do you guys have any advice for how I can salvage some semblance of a social life in my last year? TL;DR: I fucked up my social life. Advice please :)",2019-10-31 21:07:15,31

comment,Any Advice on How to Salvage My Social Life?,"of course!! i know the feeling of your social life not being where you want it to be. i’d say don’t immediately tag along for group plans if you feel uncomfortable asking. start off by hanging with your group mates individually. maybe ask them to study with you, grab lunch/dinner, etc. once you feel more comfortable with your classmates individually, you’ll feel a lot better about asking to tag along with the group as a whole for plans. or once they feel comfortable with you, they’ll feel more inclined to include you in plans it can be intimidating but your social life will get better once you put yourself out there more. i didn’t join a student org until my third year at jmu and having to mingle with people and get out of my comfort zone helped me socially",2019-11-01 00:01:03,4

comment,Just Accepted into JMU,Come to CHOICES and make your decision then. You will have the opportunity to see the school with your own eyes and speak to current students. You will also have a opportunity to lean more about JMUs programs that interest you. You want to chose the school and program that is the best fit for you even if it is not JMU. A thing to keep in mind is that JMU total cost is about $114K while most out-of-state schools are over $160K so that is a massive plus for JMU if you have to take loans.,2019-03-14 00:14:59,1

The campus is beautiful, there are lots of activities on and off campus, and it's one of the friendliest student bodies I've ever encountered — I honestly think it's because most people are just really happy there. I attended as an out-of-state student, and while I don't enjoy having to pay back student loans, I don't regret the choice I made either.

JMU also offers a broad range of other clubs and organizations that help the campus feel smaller (in a good way!). In terms of football, the games are lots of fun and we do have a good fan section, but we definitely aren’t on the same level as an SEC school when it comes to game attendance.

comment,JMU AfterDark the only app you need for late nights,"I'm looking into to those things. I'm trying to get it so there is a list of sober drivers but I have run into some problems. Once I can get sober drivers in the app allowing people to add their own cab numbers will take no time. The solutions that I believe would fix this problem really quick cost too much money but I hope to have everything figured out soon. If I don't have it done before the end of the school year I can guarantee it at the start of next school year. Until I can get the sober drivers in the app I will be using push notifications and tweeting the numbers out. So you should follow me at https://twitter.com/jmuafterdark . Also if anyone knows of any sober drivers give me their numbers and I'll send them out I may add in the drunk bus routes but I thought the JMU Bus app already did that.

One of my ideas when creating the app was to work with bars, food places, cabs, and etc. to where they would pay me to push their info out and I would do my best to get the users of the app discounts and other things. I made the app in a way that I could turn it into an iOS app right now but I have not been able to justify spending $100 to buy an Apple developer account.

comment,JMU AfterDark the only app you need for late nights,"I'm the maker of the JMU Bus App, I think I can provide some insight for you. I don't think Ad revenue will ever work for a JMU-specific app; there's simply not enough people. Ad revenue will only be substantial if you have tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of hits a day, which is impractical or impossible if you're limiting yourself to a single city. I've only made something like $30 from ads over the course of a year of trying an ad-support revenue model, with nearly 5,000 users of the Android ad-supported free version. It's also worth pointing out that I haven't been able to monetize Android users via a purchased app. I've only sold 400 something Android bus apps over the past 2.5 years.

(You can order these to come to your dorm off of Instacart or take the bus to Target/Walmart) Also, going to the dining halls during off-hours helps with the crowdedness and you can even take the food back to your dorm or eat it somewhere more private! I would recommend going at around 11 am or 2 pm for lunch and 5:00ish or 7:30 for dinner.

I never thought anything of it when I was a student, pre-Google Maps, because it made enough sense back then: I-81 is a north-south highway, therefore it must be east. But looking at Google Maps, it turns out that I-81, while it runs north-south overall, actually runs east-west in the part that goes past the campus. And that means that the ""East Campus"" is actually entirely to the south of the main campus, and only partly to the east.

Growing up there was a lot of pressure to be the “best” in academics as well as sports. I graduated with a 4.0, and I wasn’t even close to being the highest GPA in my class. At least a dozen kids had averages as high as 4.6. Our high school football team won state 3 out of the 4 years I was there. The basketball team won state at least 1, maybe 2 years, and the band & yearbook were regularly recognized for their excellence as well. It’s a competitive lil city, so I understand why outsiders can be envious. But as an insider, it can be a lot of pressure to try to live up to the “glory” of Salem’s lore. It’s not always all that “great…”",2021-02-17 10:24:33,2

comment,"Judge recommends university pay $850,000 to student it punished after exonerating him of rape claims","**Being Raped is easy. The hard part is living with being raped.** The victims lose so much of themselves during and after the incident. They lose hope. They lose faith. They lose friends. They become afraid of new relationships. They gain scars that last for years if not their lifetime. Both Males and Females can be raped. Also false rape claims are a problem for both the accused and other real victims. **The article OP posted goes into how the university is being ordered to pay for their actions after a false rape claim**. Based on your other posts on this sub I would advise you to please open your mind and mature some before coming to JMU.

If you are going to continue this as a student at JMU you will have a bad time. Part of being a Duke is stepping up when bad things have happened. If you engage in this kind of behavior as a student other Dukes will not tolerate it. We do have fun at JMU because of how us Dukes conduct ourselves. I would advise you at this point to look at the other schools you have received offers from and chose one to study at. Another valid option is to get a job and work for a few years OR enlist in the armed forces, then reapply to JMU when you have matured some. This option will also help you with paying for school.

Their are upperclassmen from SGA and Student Activities and Involvement in that group who will be happy to help you with some questions. Be sure to attend all of your frog week events. They will make it easier for you to make friends at JMU as a freshman. Stay away from ""Student Work"" jobs and Vector Marketing. Those groups prey on students. If you need work check JMU JobLink, Aramark, or the local businesses for a job. Go to student Org Night. All of the clubs will have booths setup to give you information about them and how to join. The one in the fall also has other activities going on so you can hang out after looking through the clubs. Clubs are a very good way to meet people at JMU so it is worth doing. Good luck!

comment,just applied and wanna know what harrisonburg is like,"There is a large community of queer people in Harrisonburg. Harrisonburg is often dubbed the Friendly City because of the general reputation of friendly people and furthermore, Harrisonburg and the immediate Rockingham county surrounding it houses a rather large community of Hispanic, Middle eastern, and other POC populations (this to say, JMU is still a Primarily White Institution) As for JMU specifically, you may find yourself just as safe to be yourself. There even is official resources provided by the school specifically for LGBTQIA+ and POC students. You can just look up SOGIE (Sexual Orientation Gender Identity Expression) JMU for an immediate link to their web page. Of course, the general disclaimer to give is that not everyone will agree with you being queer (I.e. there’s a house near campus that was flooded with Trump signs this last week) but I would like to believe that most people will accept you for exactly who you are and your closest friends will love you nonetheless. Harrisonburg itself isn’t some big city. You’re not going to find skyscrapers or any cool thing like that, and you may realize that large portion of the urban area quite literally just surrounds campus because JMU has such a large footprint in Harrisonburg, but it serves the needs of the large population in and around the city. Once you get outside of city limits though, it’s pretty rural in every direction. The next closest city is Staunton, just south of Harrisonburg, which is bigger than Harrisonburg, but relatively the same vibes. Also, Dayton, just a mere 10 minutes from Harrisonburg, also supports a large Amish community as well. Overall, I think you might enjoy Harrisonburg and JMU. Just remember to get involved with a couple things while you’re a student. That will seriously help that feeling of isolation you will inevitably feel if you don’t get involved. Best of luck on getting into JMU :)",2024-11-11 08:16:17,14

post,Freshman year isolation and fear for sophomore year,"Freshman year isolation and fear for sophomore year Hello, I’m a SMAD major with a digital video and cinema focus and last year was my first year as a freshman JMU and it was one of the hardest time I’ve had in my life. That might sound like a reach, and on paper it might not of looked that bad but in my entire life I had never felt more isolated than I did at JMU. I made the initial mistake of picking a suite style room at the very front of a hall in the village, tucked away from any other suites or people to congregate with. At the beginning of the year I went to all of the freshman orientation events, picnics and activities to try to make friends as only me and my boyfriend at the time had gone to JMU from our school. I came to that school with bright purple hair and eyeliner and unbeknown to me at the time that instantly made me stick out like a sore thumb in the sorority central that is the village. No matter how many girls I would try and make small talk with give my phone number to or even asked to hang out I would never hear back from them. This isn’t your typical I’m an introvert and don’t know how to make a friend college story, I am an extrovert and I am funny and I love making friends but I have never seen a more cliquey campus and felt more isolated than I did at JMU, since I really only smoke weed and try to stay away from party culture. My cousin who lives in Northern Virginia says it’s basically 13th grade for NOVA kids and it felt that way too, it felt like somehow most people already knew each other or had a friend group before they even got there and even a few people who I would pass that seemed to stray away from the blonde Ballage Lululemon copy paste (no hate they just usually stay away from talking to me) seem to have no interest in talking to me or making new friends as they already had them. And look, I know there were probably many other kids at JMU last year who had a very similar experience to me, and there’s always the join a club or do a sport, but even when I tried joining a club, no one would even talk to me because they already were such close friends I felt like I wasn’t wanted. I’m not making this post to pity myself, I wanted to share my experience to see if anyone else on here has had a similar experience of making zero friends at JMU ( since I didn’t party every weekend ) And if so, I’d love to be friends with any and all of you before going into this next school year alone again. And to anyone who has gone to JMU and had a similar experience I’d also like to open the question of whether or not you think it would be worth it to transfer",2024-07-30 13:59:53,29

I'm not that much of a heavy extrovert, but I can completely relate. I thought I'd make plenty of friends but only like three people I met at the gaming club and some events want to keep being my friend. It's rough, and I fear the same thing happening this upcoming year. But maybe to help each other out, we could get to know each other?

comment,Freshman year isolation and fear for sophomore year,"As someone who also doesn’t really participate with the party culture on campus, I get what you’re going through. It can be really hard to gain a social circle, especially in your freshman year. In my opinion, there’s always time to make friends, and I hope sophomore year gets a lot better for you because (at least for me) my friends are what really make this school. For me, clubs are what really got me to meet new people and create new friendships. I know you had difficulties finding one that allowed you to actually get to meet people without the barrier of cliques, but there are a few that really create strong communities without that clique culture. I’m not sure what type of music you’re into, but I’m the president of the Heavy Music Club on campus and we’d love to have you stop by. It’s a very chill and laidback environment, with tons of opportunities to make new friends. We have meetings every 2 weeks with some fun social events like karaoke or live concerts in TDU sprinkled in between. We also love to carpool to concerts which is fun. The “heavy” aspect of the name is completely subjective, everyone has their own preferences and we all listen to a wide variety of rock, metal, punk, indie music, and really just any genre people want to talk about.",2024-07-31 04:28:31,2

comment,Freshman year isolation and fear for sophomore year,"girl don’t listen to the negative replies 😭 u can make friends anywhere any time regardless. i originally planned on transferring after picking jmu as kind of a last minute decision bc i already knew it was gonna be nothing like nova. the copy paste and ppl already being in groups is the first thing i thought ab bc i felt so out of place when i first moved in, but eventually i started to fall in love with the campus itself. i still went to jmu open minded, went out, joined clubs, and met a lot of ppl freshman year but i just weren’t able to find my people. i mostly stopped going out spring sem and mostly hung out w my bf during the weekend bc i don’t think u will really meet meaningful ppl u wanna surround urself with at a frat party 💀 u can but it’s just unlikely and gets draining. i think what really helps is if u get to know one person, then they introduce u to ppl they know. At least that’s what kinda worked for me bc me and my roomie would always invite ppl over on a fun night and we watched movies and smoked sometimes they would bring their other friends too and we all got to know each other a bit. ur right tho a lot of ppl acts interested atm then i would never see them again and personally i’m not one to reach out and bug them so i’d just leave it at that. I did meet ppl here and there that i love hanging with for fun but it’s still not like a “friend group” or best friends. i feel like i’d belong better in a more diverse campus i’ve always wanted to go to a big city school like upitt, nyu, umich etc but at the end of the day i think i’m at jmu for a reason so why not try to make the best of it. i’m planning on giving sophomore year a try then i’m out of this place if it doesn’t work out 😭with that being said, i would love to be friends!!",2024-08-01 09:36:36,1

Well, the plan worked...kind of. The only side effect was extreme depression and loneliness. I was going to get much more involved starting my junior year, but then COVID hit. I'm just really excited that we're opening back up again and I'll finally be able to have the college experience. It was pathetic that I looked forward to my GEOG gened so much last semester because it was my only in-person class and I got to talk to real people there. Clubs have been nothing but lame GroupMe and zoom meetings which I didn't bother attending. I'm not very bitter though because since I'm in a very good place academically and physically, I think I'll be able to have fun without any sort of guilt. How has your college experience been?",2021-06-20 00:32:45,30
comment,"I will be starting my senior year as a freshman, socially speaking.","I transferred in as a junior in the fall of 2019, so I only got about a semester and a half of real college before school went online and profs started to care less. I never apply myself enough when it comes to making friends, and I made no friends in community college either, so going into the pandemic I had only a handful of people to keep in contact with. I relate a lot to how you feel. Now that things are returning to normal, I'm super excited to go back to in-person classes, but at the same time I do feel like a freshman even tho it's my senior year.",2021-06-20 11:56:28,7

I want to make a dungeons and dragons club here at JMU, and I am currently on the path to doing so. I have pretty much everything I need to make the club official, but I still want new members because to make my dream come true, I need to see a diverse community of dungeons and dragons players coming together and playing with their characters in the same world, creating an epic story. If you want to join, please join the discord and go to one of our meetings to become a full member. After you’re a full member, you can make a character which can join any club game.

Reaching out because I'm writing about COVID-19 on college campuses and how cases are being handled IRL. I'm hoping to connect with a.) anyone with campus health services who can tell me how you're currently handling cases/students coming in with symptoms (I can offer anonymity if you're worried about your name being used). b.) students affected by COVID-19 cases on campus. If you've tested positive, possibly been exposed, been asked to quarantine, or been contacted by a contact tracer (or maybe you haven't, and that's the issue), I'd love to speak with you. I'm hoping to have this story by Thursday, so please reach out soon if you're interested in speaking with me!

As long as JMU doesnt have a ""slave owning day of remeberence to our white supremacist"" event, I think its irrelevant in almost any discussion. The mentioning of JMU's demographic as a point is BS. Why not also mention its 66% women and how thats oppressing men and pushing them away from higher education (/s).

They did not yet get a response and they prefer not to involve the state police, which is probably a preference based on jurisdictional matters. Once the internal investigation is complete, they can release the footage without infringing on the officers' rights (they get due process, too) and any FOIA requests must be honored at that point. This is a non-starter. They had the police on film telling the dude to ditch the gun 40+ times and he not only refused after having had that gun to a guy's chest while threatening to pull the trigger, but left with the gun. None of that is disuputed. I am sorry for the father's loss, but this really sounds like a clean shoot that is made even more unfortunate by the father's insitance on seeing his son get shot in order to place blame on the police when it was clear the guy was a threat.",2016-03-31 11:36:00,1

Your major only really defines what you study, your free time is yours to do what you want. For example I’m in a music fraternity that is composed of ~50% non-music majors. If you’re interested in marching band, the MRDs are an awesome and welcoming group. You can join concert band, one of the University Choirs, or tryout for any ensemble. The theatre is a growing department and the Forbes Center is wonderful to perform in. I’d love to help find someone with more knowledge if you have any other questions.",2016-04-03 01:31:01,1

comment,Can we get a discussion post going for newly admitted students?,"I don't know anything about Pitt's program, but I can say that our robotics offering is small and is only available as a minor at this point. That said, the program is built by faculty from CS, ISAT, Engineering, and Physics, so you do get a broad background from a lot of different perspectives. In general, the question to ask when comparing JMU to other schools is, how much of their effort is spent on graduate programs, and what can you actually get involved in? JMU is not a doctoral research school, and even our CS masters program is very small, so what you see when you tour is all available to you. When you tour other schools, ask tough questions about what is actually available to undergraduates, and how much time you actually get to spend with faculty. Their labs may look cool, but if you can't touch, what use is it to you? I've had several friends go on to top-notch graduate programs after JMU, so I've never seen our offerings as a limitation to what you do later. All that said, if you want to talk details about JMU's CS/AI/Robotics, contact Dr. Sprague. He's lead the robotics program since he came to JMU and I'm sure would be more than happy to talk about it.",2016-04-07 09:32:14,3

You are required to log urec hours which means you have to go to the gym basically every week. You don't have to do anything actually physical though. Some people went into urec just to study and log hours. There are multiple kin classes that fulfill the requirement.

comment,Can we get a discussion post going for newly admitted students?,"I actually just switched from CS to CIS, but here's what I can say for certain. Typically all the majors within the COB are five year degrees. You have to take 10 lower level business courses (which include class like Micro/Macroeconomics, Accounting, etc.) then you have to formally apply to the College of Business. If you keep a 2.7 GPA in your COB course, you'll get accepted. That GPA though is only the total of the COB courses you take, not all of the classes you take at JMU. Once you get accepted into the COB, you have to take COB 300 A, B, C, and D. These courses are a focus on different aspects within business, and you also have to work with a group to create a business plan. Once you get accepted into the College of Business, that's when you can actually take courses that are CIS classes (other then taking COB 204, which is CIS that is required in the lower level COB courses). From what I've heard, the CIS program is a good one. Also, the College of Business here is really good. A lot of companies look positively upon the way JMU has the programs set up. I'm posting a link that may also be able to give you some additional information. Hope this helps, and let me know if you have any other questions about CIS, COB, or other aspects of campus. :) http://www.jmu.edu/cob/cis/about/quick-facts.pdf",2016-03-28 18:12:40,2

comment,Can we get a discussion post going for newly admitted students?,"I worked off campus Sophomore through Senior year, at some points at two jobs.

Find something that's flexible where you're not working every day, but still make decent money. I was an intern/instructor at Wintergreen and had to be there 4 days a week at 7am, including Saturdays, so I had to wake up early those days and cut partying short on Friday night, but it was worth it because I was paid well. I used my car a lot in general, you don't have to to get around Hburg I'm just lazy, so having some income to cover gas was nice and being able to go out to eat at a decent place once in a while was nice too.

comment,Can we get a discussion post going for newly admitted students?,I enjoy it a lot! A lot of the professors I've had are extremely kind and helpful.

I know a lot of people who are graduating early and saving an extra year/semester of tuition bc of it. The actual students are also all pretty fucking awesome and friendly. As for internships I haven't had any issue finding them. There is a huge career/internship fair run by jmu each semester and the CS program also does one just for CS students each semester. I have been interning at Northrop Grumman for a little while and I talk to their JMU liaison a decent amount.

comment,Favorite piece of JMU history?,"I suspect that the tunnels under the quad were always intended to be just utility chases, but may have doubled as walkways for students at some point in history. The secondary theater was called Theater II, and it was in an old poultry facility located [here](https://maps.app.goo.gl/Qo3uzSbFHEuo6pRe7). The Forbes Center replaced it, and then it was demolished, as the facility was in very poor condition. It worked well enough as a little experimental theater while it was around. The tree house dorms were indeed the fraternity houses at one time. That change began in 2000, and was a gradual process. It started after Chi Phi lost its charter at the end of the fall 1999 semester, and their former fraternity house was turned into a dorm for transfer students the following fall. My understanding is that most fraternities were not ""kicked off campus"", but rather, they found it more beneficial to have their own facilities off campus and left their spaces on what was called ""Greek Row"" at the time. I want to say that the only one to be explicitly kicked out was Chi Phi, and that was because they lost their charter, i.e. they were forcibly disbanded, and their former members were given alumni status regardless of where they were in their college career, specifically so that they couldn't join another Greek-letter organization in the future.",2024-12-28 11:40:33,2

post,Advice for Incoming Freshman,"Advice for Incoming Freshman Take pride and complete your work honestly. Put yourself above your peers who use ChatGPT and learn something. ""Muh but I want to drink rn, not do my history homework"" grow up, you can drink later (with the presence of your parents in their own home, legally speaking). Gen-Eds: They can be interesting. Some of my favorite classes and profs have been Gen-Eds. They might not be important to your major, but they affect your GPA and offer you a well-rounded education. Capitalize on that opportunity. RAs: They are there for you. RAs ""wear a lot of hats"", but each 'hat' is centered around making your life as a freshman at JMU as smooth, safe, and productive as possible. They are resources for you. If you need help, ask and they will provide to the best of their ability. Just like any other job, some of them are bad at it and some of them are good at it. If you know that your RA can't/won't help you with something then go find another RA in the building. They are also narcs!!! Loud music, especially past quiet hours, is usually what leads them to find residents drinking. Feel free to add any additional advice in the comments.",2024-06-12 04:35:39,28
comment,Advice for Incoming Freshman,So glad I graduated before AI became a big issue. I was falsely accused of using it last semester and had to purposely add grammar errors to my writing to throw off TurnItIn. Formal writing often gets flagged. My advice to freshmen? Document everything you write in google docs. Use your version history to defend yourself.,2024-06-12 11:53:53,27
comment,Advice for Incoming Freshman,"Biggest piece of advice: meet as many people as you can, as soon as you can. Meet everyone in your hall. Rush/join an organization. Be social and say hi to people on campus that might peek ur interest. It’s nerve wracking at first but becomes second habit. Those first few weeks of school, anyone will talk to u!",2024-06-12 10:52:03,14
comment,Advice for Incoming Freshman,"As a former History TA if you're struggling with understanding the content or assignments utilize whatever TAs your courses provide much as you need. Gen ed classes typically have 100+ students in them, and professors don't have the ability to always respond. That's what we were for on top of teaching the discussion sections. The TAs there now want to see you succeed because we were once freshmen in college too. Building off that, be honest with yourself and the professors. If you are struggling mentally and it is affecting your performance/attendance in a class, reach out to them immediately, don't fall off the grid for weeks then show up at the end of the semester to explain the situation. While you may be telling the truth, it would be hard to recover your grade. But if you reach out, teachers will help you get any assistance you may need and the two of you can formulate a plan on making up any missed work. Get out and have fun! Campus and Harrisonburg in general has a lot of fun stuff imo. Hang out with some friends by Newman Lake, food downtown is great, or explore the plethora of social clubs JMU has to offer. There is also a farmers market by city hall and one that comes to campus in the spring. Taking breaks and getting outside will help with burnout and social clubs might help college not seem such a daunting experience. Overall, enjoy the experience you're about to have. You'll learn a lot about yourself, make some of the closest friends you'll ever have, and hopefully have a blast doing it.",2024-06-12 21:19:59,6
comment,Advice for Incoming Freshman,"I have a couple of thing: -If you struggling in class go to your professors office hours, this is like the man thing freshman don’t do because high school doesn’t condition them to do it but trust me going to office hours consistently will help understand the material but professors maybe just pass you if they see effort (this is rare but it’s happened to me) also ssc has tutors that are super helpful (literally sitting there with the tutors and do your hw if your struggling) -the first piece was about being successful in school but remember school isn’t everything certainly make sure you pass your class but don’t kill your self to get straight A’s unless your planing and doing school your grades don’t really matter that much in terms of jobs, it’s possible your first job might ask for a transcript but it never happened to me -a lot of people seem to thing that when you go to college you’ll magically make friends this isn’t really true you have to put yourself out there talk to the people on your hall join some clubs or rush even if putting yourself after out there and making new friends maybe scary at first it will make your time at jmu you the best time of your life and being able to make friends and talk people you don’t know is a incredible valuable life skill I am just putting my thoughts in a comment so it may not read very well and pm if you want to know anything else",2024-06-14 09:40:14,3

comment,Advice for Incoming Freshman,"I would be leery about using ChatGPT for anything beyond simple amusement. I ran a test with it on myself last year, and the results were amusing. I have an uncommon last name and [a very large online presence](https://www.schuminweb.com/), so ChatGPT knew who I was, and also knew about the website, and spat out some information about both me as an individual and about the website, as I ran the queries five different times for each of them. The responses that I got were of questionable accuracy. The information about me was laughably inaccurate, as it got several biographical details about me wrong, attributed many accolades to me that I have never sought nor received, and placed me at various colleges and universities that I never attended (I only attended JMU). As for the website, it did a little better about that, presumably since the entire body of work was available for it to ingest, though I still wouldn't rely on ChatGPT's analysis of it as far as I could throw it. Here's my discussion about what ChatGPT said: https://www.schuminweb.com/2023/03/10/it-both-impresses-me-and-amuses-me/ So, unless you are specifically looking for content for entertainment purposes, give ChatGPT a pass.

post,The Altitude Phase II Move-in Delay,"The Altitude Phase II Move-in Delay I was scheduled to move in to the brand new building of The Altitude today and they just delayed the move in until at least the 25th. I'm sure I'm not the only one getting screwed over by this especially since they only announced the delay at around 9:30am TODAY. Fortunately they're paying to put residents up at a hotel until the building is complete but they seriously should have alerted us to this possibility weeks in advance. Just looking at the building you can tell it was never going to be finished on time and it's incredibly shady and borderline malicious that they would wait until now to delay. My only hope is that there's some complete restructuring of management at The Altitude to ensure this kind of situation doesn't happen again. &#x200B; If anyone else is being affected by this, if you could let me know which hotel of the choices provided you'll be requesting.

I'm currently staying at the Hilton Double Tree near Lowes and it's pretty good all things considered. Still mad as hell that this happened but at least they didn't send us to some sketchy place in Harrisonburg. As I understand it, residents who choose to stay in a hotel paid for by Altitude will receive $25 per day towards their rent when Phase II opens. Those who don't will be given $75 dollars per day towards their rent.

comment,Governor’s Mask Policy,"> It’s literally the flu I’m not going to get into the rest of your comment, but this part I will. No, it’s not. The flu had a per capita death rate of 1.8 deaths per 100,000 people between 1999 and 2019 in the US. COVID’s rate in the US is 217.54 per 100,000 people. COVID killed more than 8 times more people in the US in 2021 than the worst flu season on record in the past decade. On top of just deaths, COVID has proven to have a significantly higher rate of long-term damage than the flu. Just because someone survives doesn’t mean that they’re back to normal afterwards and thriving.

They need to remind them, and if they see them again or multiple times, then out they go! Why is everyone so opposed to personal responsibility and the consequences of not following rules? I'll posit this: How often do you even see the employees tell people to put their weights back or wipe down equipment? I'd say it's around the same rate that they tell people about the masks. Yesterday, I saw a group of 7 students all talking, congregating, etc... in front of the *entrance* to the main gym area, with their masks below their chins. They stood there for probably 10-15min and not one employee came by, nor said anything.

Everyone who lives off-campus is going to return regardless and will absolutely 100% continue to go to parties and bars and you're delusional if you think otherwise. Whether or not it's the right decision to move us online is not my call. But stopping in-person classes, where we wear masks and do not physically touch one another, is not going to halt the spread when there are hundreds of people in a crowded party three miles down the road. Besides, from what I've heard, we don't have the funds. We're damn near broke as an institution. We aren't a small Northeast private college with an endowment in the multi-billions.

The process is super easy, I had to do a Zoom interview just explaining that I had intentions to come back but. I needed a break and you can take up to 2 full years off without needing to reapply. I moved in with my parents, worked and really focused on what I needed to feel better. Coming back to school this year was an adjustment and a little rocky at first, but I don't know if I would have made it if i didn't take that time off. Trust you gut! You know when you can struggle through and when you need to tap out for a little bit. And taking a break is nothing to be ashamed of!!

They should be able to provide you with all the resources for what a leave of absence would mean and walk you through the process. If you have a mental health leave of absence form filled out, I don't believe you have to do it by any deadline but don't quote me on that. I took a leave of absence and found it to be really beneficial. You'll have to check how long you need to be absent, but for me I had to take the following semester off as well. So, I just took a couple community college classes. Besides taking those classes, my only other focus was working on my mental health. Overall, I don't have any regrets about. I was able to come back in a much place in terms of my mental health, academically, and socially.

comment,leave of absence - mental health,"I withdrew once for disability related health issues and an incomplete once for mental health issues. They were helpful AF at the Dean of Students Office so even if you don’t decide to withdraw or anything they can talk you through options better than we can and they’re really kind about it. You might be able to just talk to your teachers and sort of put the semester on pause with an incomplete- you finish the work at a date you work out with them and get a grade of incomplete in the mean time. Incomplete is a tricky thing to do though because if you try to dive right back in afterwards and take classes at the same time as you finish your old work you double up on what you have to do and it can feel easy to put the work off until the last minute which really sets you up for failure. The Deans office could talk you through this and mediate with your teachers if you tried this but you don’t have to. Withdraws give you time to break off completely without something hanging over you and means you don’t have to juggle further work while you recover. If you withdraw you don’t get any credit for the classes you took and you don’t get all of your tuition money back. If you do decide to withdraw you’ll need permission for your doctor to both leave and return. This would all go through the Dean and the one I spoke to a few semesters ago (Gloria) covered lots of bases and made it as easy as possible with step by step directions. If you decide to do an incomplete tell your teachers that you’re looking to withdraw. Most teachers take that to mean you’re serious, things are bad, and take a closer look at how they can help you. Personally I don’t recommend taking an incomplete unless you’re feeling ok with the material and are taking a fairly long break. If you’re going to jump back into class the next semester that means you either haven’t given yourself a proper holiday in the mean time or are now dealing with twice as much class work. I just wanted to give you another possible option. I hope you do whats right for you and totally get in touch with them even if you’re not sure because they can point you in lots of different helpful directions.

All that being said, I still really enjoyed my freshman year and living there. I met a lot of people and I liked being close to Mrs. Greens and not too far from the quad.

There also wasn't any WiFi in the building at the time (may have changed). I think the location was also a little far from everything. Some might argue that it's in the middle of campus, but I always felt the Village was truly in the middle. That being said... A dorm doesn't make or break your freshman experience. You're still at JMU, you're still probably gonna have classes scattered across campus, and you're still gonna have all the ups and downs all freshmen have.

comment,Is eagle hall really that bad?,"Hi! I lived there last year. No AC for the first two months was rough, I’ll admit. Bring 2 box fans and put it in the window, it’ll create a slight AC unit.

Besides the fire drills that scare the shit out of you, the people are fantastic. I wouldn’t trade that for anything. You meet the best people, and go through the same struggles! Also, when you tell people you live in Eagle, you definitely get street cred. All in all, not bad at all, more of a character building experience.

comment,JMU student Luciano Benjamin running for Harrisonburg City Council,"JMU has over 21,000 students that live in Harrisonburg for the majority of the year. I think it's a good thing that someone wants to represent them and not just people that own property in the city.",2020-02-10 08:11:01,4
comment,JMU student Luciano Benjamin running for Harrisonburg City Council,"you don't need to be represented if you don't live there. the economy takes y'all into effect. Their business structures are often planned around the school. why would you need to be represented more? you already are taken into account and considered a valuable asset to be taken care of and listened too. It's their city. not yours. you are a guest for four years. Most of harrisonburg is meth addicted truck drivers and welders and construction workers. You live a whole other protected life, what makes you think you know about their economy and their issues because you lived there 7 months out of the year for four years. Especially considering if you read the article and see it's mainly about his stance on climate change and homelessness. Like that's the problems harrisonburg faces really? Not that big of a homeless population on the streets as most people take each other in and help their neighbor. you think farmers are all in on climate change in this area? fixing that would mean less livestock (which hello farming is their main source of income that isn't feasable) as it isn't a big city with electrical waste. This guy clearly knows nothing other than JMU. Try fixing the local schools, or even improve in acquiring better doctors at RMH as most people go to augusta instead. Or maybe rehabilitation clinics for drug addicts.",2020-02-11 00:57:42,-3

comment,PSA: Buy renters insurance,"Agreed. Also, look for a sprinkler system in the properties where you are thinking about living, because that makes a ton of difference between a massive fire like what happened at South View and nipping it in the bud. Also make sure that the fire alarm system works. Ask to see the panel. I remember back in 2003 at Stone Gate that the fire alarm system was inoperable in one of the buildings (pull station was down and no alarm was sounding).",2019-03-28 13:06:49,15

comment,Jack Browns Sauce Recipe,"Original Ingredients: 11 cups diced onion 2/3 cup minced garlic 28 ounces Worcestershire sauce 2.5 cups brown mustard 8 cups ketchup 64 ounces May Ploy (which I assume is a type of sweet chili sauce) 4 teaspoons pepper 4 gallons Duke’s mayo Since the total volume here is very large, we’ll start by estimating the scale factor for 1 cup. The total volume of the original recipe is roughly 130 cups (11 cups onions + 8 cups ketchup + 2.5 cups mustard + etc.), so for a 1-cup batch, we need to reduce the quantities by a factor of about 130. Scaled-down recipe (1 cup total): Diced onion: 11 cups ÷ 130 = about 1 tablespoon Minced garlic: 2/3 cup ÷ 130 = about 1 teaspoon Worcestershire sauce: 28 oz ÷ 130 = about 1/4 cup (4 tablespoons) Brown mustard: 2.5 cups ÷ 130 = about 2 tablespoons Ketchup: 8 cups ÷ 130 = about 1/2 cup May Ploy (sweet chili sauce): 64 oz ÷ 130 = about 1/2 cup Pepper: 4 teaspoons ÷ 130 = about 1/4 teaspoon Duke’s mayo: 4 gallons ÷ 130 = about 1/3 cup",2025-01-19 18:56:56,1

comment,"To celebrate Fall approaching, here's some photos of places in the valley that I think are hidden gems!","Basically to fish in any freshwater you need a basic VA freshwater license, then if the water is trout stocked, you need a trout stamp ON TOP OF the fishing license to fish there between October and May I believe. You will of course need an out-of-state license (unless you can get in state since you go to school here) which is a bit more than in-state. I would go to the Rockingham Cooperative which is a local outdoor store/hardware store on the corner of South High Street and South Avenue. They are very knowledgeable and can determine the best license / price for your situation. You can also buy a license online at http://www.dgif.virginia.gov.

post,Thinking abt jmu?,"Thinking abt jmu? Heyyy seniors (or other high schoolers) as a freshman I'm gonna try to give my best rundown on the pros and cons of jmu. Location: kinda middle of nowhere, closest Trader Joe's is 30 mins away, beautiful mountains for hiking and skiing only 20-30 mins away. Dorms: rly depends on what you want, lots of stem majors, upperclassmen, and athletes live in skyline and it's a nice area, village is known for partying and is where a lot of Greek life ppl live, but the buildings are old, bluestone is so pretty and have jack and Jill suites, others are just regular hall style and don't rly have a ""type"" of person who lives there. Avoid Eagle and shorts if you can. Orgs: so many orgs. Greek life is big and awesome if you're interested, but easily avoidable if not, other Greek orgs (service, academic, etc) are really great as well and where a lot of ppl find their best friends, highly recommend. Also club and intramural teams are popular.. just join what you're interested in and you'll find lots of great people! Campus: main is gorgeous, no notes. East is nice, slightly uglier buildings but has a great view of the mountains, also there's a whole arboretum you can hike or hang out at that's gorgeous. Especially beautiful in the warm weather but really nice all around. Sports: can't speak for playing a sport, but football games are the best time of the year, tailgates everywhere, hotdogs for a punch, the most spirit it's the best. Tbh haven't seen any other teams play. Parties: just your average frat parties on thursdays and Fridays mostly, but any girl is welcome sorority member or not, and boys are allowed in some of the lower tier ones. Darties on Saturday are a lot of fun too. Frog week and Halloweekend are super busy but the best time ever. Safety: mostly safe area but there are some occasions of break in's off campus. Chloe van Berkels apartment got broken into. Townies can be odd but I've personally never had a bad experience with them. Culture: Dukes hold doors is very real and you will be judged if you don't. Food: ranked highly but D-Hall can be VERY repetitive, ehall too but it's generally better. Dukes dining has lots of options but most places are only open for a few hours. I recommend bistro in the ssc, Panda Express in dukes, and dhall deserts the most. UREC: deserves its own section bc it's the best. If you like to work out the gym is rly nice but can get busy. Highly highly recommend signing up for group exercise classes (Pilates, yoga, etc). Also has cooking classes, hikes, rides to the ski mountain, alpaca walks, and more cool activities you can sign up for. Academics: check rate my professor before signing up for classes every time. Profs can be really great or really awful. Great business and nursing programs. Classes can be huge lectures, but all of mine this sem are abt 20-30 ppl as a freshman taking 3 gen Ed's and 2 major classes. Also registering for classes sucks every time wo fail. Avoid memorial if you can it's very far (not easy if you're an education major) Overall I love it here and I highly recommend it.",2025-03-24 23:00:15,26

comment,freshman anxiety :~),"None of the incoming freshman have done this before. You're all unsure how 1787 is going to go, and uncertainty can be stressful! But, once you realize everyone around you is wondering if you're as nervous getting thrown into all of this as they are, you're fine. You may be an introvert. I am too. Do what you can to make friends. The stress involved with putting yourself out there to hang out with people pays off when you leave college and have lifelong friends to stay in touch with. So the very first time you get invited to something, ignore the part of you that is saying no and just say yes. You never know which people might one day become your new close circle. It gets a lot harder, perhaps very hard to make new friends one you graduate college because everyone gets locked into their new life and stop branching out. Right now, everyone is meeting each other for the first time and looking to make new friends. You've got one good shot at this so keep doing stuff, keep meeting people and join some groups this year or next. Don't graduate in a few years and have serious regrets!",2020-08-21 08:29:15,4

post,Friendly PSA: JMU CAN SEE NEARLY ANYTHING ON YOU DO ON YOUR COMPUTER THROUGH THEIR NETWORK,"Friendly PSA: JMU CAN SEE NEARLY ANYTHING ON YOU DO ON YOUR COMPUTER THROUGH THEIR NETWORK Today I received an email from one of my professors from this past semester basically railing everybody out for cheating on his tests which we took in class on canvas. He didn't use lockdown browser so people would obviously try to look up the answers. THIS CAN GET YOU FUCKED. In the email he claims that he can somehow tell when canvas was minimized or another tab was clicked. I've tried to research wether or not this is true and cant find anything conclusive. However, IF YOU ARE ON JMU'S NETWORK THEY CAN SEE WHAT YOU ACCESS ON THE INTERNET AND WHEN YOU DO IT. As you can imagine, this would make it way too easy for a professor to prove any suspicions he or she had. Obviously we dont have people tracking this stuff 24/7 but it is on file and can be accessed if the professor is suspicious of honor code violation. YOUR EMAIL IS NOT PRIVATE. This I actually dont know for sure about JMU however after a little research i found that many other schools do have access to their students uni emails. Same as before, no one is going through reading the millions of emails there are but if they needed to go find one they could. I'm not trying to push honor code violations with this but the amount of people I've talked to that dont think JMU can see this stuff is absurd. You're on their wifi. There is very little privacy. Be smart. EDIT: tell yo frands",2015-05-11 16:07:37,28
comment,Friendly PSA: JMU CAN SEE NEARLY ANYTHING ON YOU DO ON YOUR COMPUTER THROUGH THEIR NETWORK,"This past academic year, I was in a facilitation position where I had full access to Canvas, meaning that I could utilize all of the tools that professors or teachers had. I'll try to clarify some of OP's points about Canvas, and I'll bring up some other things I learned to use: - In terms of looking at open/closed tabs (what OP is most concerned about), there IS NOT a tool on Canvas where you can see a student's search history during the quiz. If a student took a quiz on the JMU network, then of course, the professor could always go to JMU I.T. and have them look it up, but that is a ton of effort. There is no short-cut tool to look at a search history through Canvas. And keep in mind, if a professor gives a quiz that should take 5 minutes, but the student is on the site for 15-20 minutes, then one might have stronger evidence to infer cheating. - For quizzes and other assessments, there are a lot of analytic tools that teachers can use to learn about a test. This is especially useful when sorting students responses by time. First off, you can look at when students start/end tests. If three kids are taking a quiz together in a lab and are doing it at the same time, you can sort those three kids out, and then easily look at answer distributions among those three kids. In addition, say a quiz is open during a 12-hour window. If 5 students are getting a question wrong early into the window, but then one of them provides a classmate with the proper answer, and the remaining 15 students in the class get the answer correct later in the window, the data system will be able to easily draw attention to that pattern. - teachers can look at a student's accessibility to different messages, discussion boards, and readings. For example, if I were to post a document, I can look at which students actually downloaded it, or if it is an embedded PDF, I can look at how long the student viewed the PDF (so if they spent 15 seconds viewing a 30 page article, I know they're lying). - E-mail servers: Very easy for administrators/other people in power to access your JMU account. In the case of honor code violations, if the student is brought up to the council, then at that point, IT specialists can do searches, like ""Smith GHIST101 Chapter 7 Quiz"" and then any e-mail or forwarding chain could pop up. If Professor Johnson thinks you're cheating, he can't go and look it up, there needs to be the probable cause or formal honor code violation paperwork needs to be filed before that happens. And of course, in the case of criminal activity (i.e. a sexual assault at a frat party), investigators can search for key words/persons of interest to find text or subject lines. Searching for e-mail is not something a professor or administrator can do instantaneously, but be very very careful about what you post through JMU servers or JMU e-mail, in the case you are being accused of something. Phew, that was a lot of text, but hope that brings to light what can be done and is clarifying! TL;DR: Don't cheat and be very aware of what you do online",2015-05-11 19:08:49,18
comment,Friendly PSA: JMU CAN SEE NEARLY ANYTHING ON YOU DO ON YOUR COMPUTER THROUGH THEIR NETWORK,"Most of the things mentioned above are true. A few tips for JMU students looking for privacy online: 1. 100% privacy is very unlikely, but there are steps you can take to remain more anonymous. 2. Use a tor browser 3. Do NOT use JMU email. Everything is monitored. And who wants those annoying informationals anyway? 4. Connect to your own hotspot. Using JMU WiFi on unsecure services is prone to identifying illegal or mischievous activity. 5. It is unlikely that they know which websites you visited and have proof that you actually read the material on opened tabs. It looks like a false threat. However, anominymity is the easiest way to stay safe.",2015-05-11 18:45:06,10

comment,Friendly PSA: JMU CAN SEE NEARLY ANYTHING ON YOU DO ON YOUR COMPUTER THROUGH THEIR NETWORK,"The one I use is a paid service, but I believe all are unfortunately. However in my opinion they are worth it as it makes you a completely anonymous web user to anyone (including your ISP). The benefits are endless, especially if you are the type of person who does malicious activity on the internet (not saying you are)! Setup is simple, you make an account with a VPN service, in my case Vypr/Golden Frog, and then you download an application which connects you to any one of their VPN servers around the globe. Most services have several servers located around the US, as well as in other countries. This is very beneficial if you are traveling outside of the country per say, and need to access a website that is only available in the U.S. You can connect to a U.S. server at the touch of a button. It is hard to sum up the benefits of using a VPN in a Reddit comment, but just know the main reason why they are so useful is a truly untraceable web experience when used with a browser in private or incognito mode.",2015-05-14 20:18:18,1

comment,Are clubs actually helpful at JMU?,"I went to an information session for Delta Sigma Pi one time back in 2000. I remember being very unimpressed by them. Most of the slides that they showed of their activities depicted them partying and drinking, and I didn't want to associate with any of that. It made me feel like they were no different than the social frats that I also wanted nothing to do with.",2020-05-30 18:23:22,2
comment,Are clubs actually helpful at JMU?,"They were kicked off I think back in 2018. I know some ppl who were in it, they literally said they were basically a social fraternity. They still had some remaining brothers tho, but its not like they take a new member class, like off campus social fraternities. There were rumors they were coming, but I highly doubt since a new business fraternity has come to campus. So they basically won't be a thing anymore after the end of this academic year.",2020-06-05 00:30:42,2
comment,Are clubs actually helpful at JMU?,"I would probably wager jmu as a whole is completely different institution then it was 20 years ago, they definitely don’t promote drinking/ partying now. But thats why going to information sessions is important, you probably wouldn’t of liked being apart of it then. I wasn’t in DSP but I thought there was decent balance between professional development and social events. They’re your friends, so that’s who you end up partying with.",2020-05-30 18:28:42,1
comment,Are clubs actually helpful at JMU?,"No doubt JMU is a very different institution than it was back when I was a student. Meanwhile, as far as DSP goes, they apparently [lost their charter](https://www.deltasigmapi.org/news/news-details/2018/04/02/delta-sigma-pi-closes-iota-kappa-chapter) back in 2018 for violations of fraternity and university policies.",2020-05-30 19:16:18,3
comment,Are clubs actually helpful at JMU?,DSP was always known as the professional business fraternity that consider themselves a social fraternity. Serious amounts of hazing. They thought they were hot stuff during the years I was there. I loved my business fraternity and I just felt like DSP made the rest of us look bad.,2020-05-31 00:09:24,3

comment,How do I make friends,"Friday night (I think) there is a night to talk to/join clubs. Find one you would like to try and that is the best place to start meeting people in small groups. Also try out something at URec. You can do it! Start with one person to talk with and build from there. Here is the club list, so many interesting things. https://beinvolved.jmu.edu/club_signup?view=all&",2025-08-21 17:40:47,23
comment,How do I make friends,"If you have classes without seating charts, sit somewhere new every lecture until you find people you like being around and don’t be afraid to join in conversations! There are way more people in the same boat than you probably think",2025-08-21 18:39:22,10

comment,How do I make friends,This is gonna sound cliche but randomly talking to people who you feel like put out a good vibe will get you so far tbh. I’m an extroverted person and I was still intimidated by talking to strangers at college because it seemed like I was out of my depth being away from home/home friends. But I promise ESPECIALLY as a freshman so so many people feel the exact way you do and I promise as long as you give back friendly energy and try to connect in class or clubs you’ll meet your crew :) I go to jmu and I met most of my friends by asking random people in my building for directs or their advice on room decor,2025-08-21 22:50:38,5

comment,How do I make friends,Clubs & class are great for meeting people. I think it’s important to remember you don’t have to have a huge group of friends. Freshman year I enjoyed spending time with hall mates and then sophomore year I stumbled into a lifelong friendship that is the best thing JMU brought me. Sometimes it takes time but you will find your people,2025-08-21 22:32:51,2
comment,How do I make friends,"Find something you enjoy doing that gets you around other people and just Show Up. It’s really that simple. Show up day after day, week after week, and you will make friends with the people there. Classes are not the best way to do this. You don’t have social time in the class and you won’t keep seeing the same people for longer than a semester.",2025-08-22 10:15:58,1

comment,How do I make friends,"I'd say any organization, but not in a club way. Like band, acapella, those kind of groups that are more tight knit and are people joining for a common interest rather than networking or teaching in some way if that makes sense. those groups are where I see a lot of people make friends!! like stuff that forces interaction. rather than a psych club or art club, smth like poker club or empowerment 3 was definitely helpful!! also theres so many free UREC activities like cooking and exercise classes that may not gurantee friends but force u to go out and socilize helps with loneliness. hope this helps!!",2025-08-24 00:33:12,1

comment,How do I make friends,Yeah I’m also new but URec group fitness classes are free and they seem like a fun way to meet people!,2025-08-22 23:39:19,1
comment,How do I make friends,Yeah I’ve been trying to do that a lot and I have talked to quite a few random people I guess (out of my comfort zone as an introvert too). But it’s only really led to surface level conversations or to nothing at all so far. I’m gonna keep trying to push myself to do these uncomfortable things I guess. I’m a transfer student as well so I’m actually a junior so it’s kinda awkward but most people have been nice so far. I’ll have to go to some clubs and put myself out there. Thanks for the advice,2025-08-21 22:54:19,5

comment,How do I make friends,"You’ll need something that puts you in conversation with other people regardless of relative skill level. Team sports, partner dancing, and other similar activities work well for this. Solo sports or things like roller skating don’t. With solo sports, you’re not really in a position to talk much. With things like roller skating, most people aren’t good enough at first even to stay close enough to other people to talk at all, let alone be able to carry on a conversation.",2025-08-22 11:40:34,1
