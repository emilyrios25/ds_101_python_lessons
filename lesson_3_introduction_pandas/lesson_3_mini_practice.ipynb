    "\n",
    "Plotly is a powerful visualization library that allows you to make interactive graphics with relatively few lines of code. The basic format is always the same. You create a plotly object by running a function:\n",
    "\n",
    "```python\n",
    "\n",
    "figure = px.chart_type(dataframe,\n",
    "                        x='column_representing_x_data',\n",

    "\n",
    "```\n",
    "**Note** If you do not enter styling information and labels, Plotly leaves these blank. All key=value pairs (i.e. `color='type'`) should be followed by a comma except for the last one."
